                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 2
                    "Reading Before Changing" - The Important Habit
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 2!

This exercise reinforces the most important habit: ALWAYS check permissions
with `ls -l` before using `chmod`. This helps you understand what you're
changing and why.

EXERCISE:
---------
Practice the "read before change" pattern with multiple scripts.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Make sure you're in the scripts/broken directory:
   cd ../../scripts/broken
   (or use: pwd to check your location)

2. FIRST, check the permissions of all scripts:
   ls -l

3. Look at the output. Identify which scripts are missing the 'x' permission

4. For each script missing 'x', add execute permission:
   chmod +x backup.sh
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   chmod +x cleanup.sh

5. Verify the changes:
   ls -l

6. Try running each script to confirm they work:
   ./backup.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ./cleanup.sh

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l (check permissions first!)
- chmod +x <script> (for each script)
- ./<script> (test after fixing)

WHAT TO LEARN:
--------------
The pattern you should always follow:
1. Read permissions (ls -l)
2. Identify what's missing (no 'x')
3. Fix permissions (chmod +x)
4. Verify the fix (ls -l again)
5. Test the script (./script.sh)

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After fixing all scripts, write in my_answers.txt:
- List all the scripts you found that were missing 'x'
- What were the permissions of backup.sh before fixing?
- What were the permissions of backup.sh after fixing?
- Why is it important to check permissions before changing them?
