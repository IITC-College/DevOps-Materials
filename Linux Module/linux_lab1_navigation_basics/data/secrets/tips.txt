                    NAVIGATION TIPS AND TRICKS
================================================================================

Welcome to the secrets of Linux navigation!

TIP 1: Always Know Where You Are
---------------------------------
Use 'pwd' frequently. It's your GPS in the file system.

TIP 2: Going Back is Easy
--------------------------
Use 'cd ..' to go up one level.
Use 'cd ../..' to go up two levels.
You can chain as many as needed: 'cd ../../..'

TIP 3: Hidden Files are Everywhere
-----------------------------------
Files starting with '.' are hidden.
Use 'ls -a' to see them all.
Common hidden files: .bashrc, .gitignore, .env

TIP 4: Read Error Messages
---------------------------
Linux tells you exactly what's wrong.
"No such file or directory" means the path doesn't exist.
Read the message - it's trying to help you!

TIP 5: Home is Where ~ Is
--------------------------
The ~ symbol represents your home directory.
'cd ~' always takes you home.
'cd ~/projects' goes to projects in your home.

TIP 6: Practice Makes Perfect
------------------------------
Navigation seems hard at first, but with practice
it becomes second nature. Keep practicing!

FINAL ADVICE:
-------------
Don't be afraid to explore. The worst that can happen
is an error message, and those are actually helpful!
Always use pwd if you're lost, and cd ~ to get home.

Happy navigating!
