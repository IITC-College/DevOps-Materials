# Linux Lab - Navigation Basics

Welcome to your Linux navigation practice lab!

## Installation Instructions

### Method 1: Download with curl (Recommended)

```bash
curl -L -o lab.tar.gz https://github.com/IITC-College/DevOps-Jan26/releases/download/v1.1/linux_navigation_basics.tar.gz
tar -xzf lab.tar.gz
cd linux_navigation_basics
```

## Lab Objective

In this lab you will practice basic Linux navigation commands and learn to read command-line errors:

- **Navigation**: `cd`, `cd ..`, `pwd`
- **Listing Files**: `ls`, `ls -a`
- **Error Messages**: Understanding what Linux tells you when something goes wrong
- **Hidden Files**: Recognizing and finding files that start with a dot

## How to Start?

1. Open the `start_here.txt` file - this is where to begin!
2. Read the instructions carefully
3. Follow the exercises step by step

```bash
cat start_here.txt
```

## Exercise List

### Exercise 1: Understanding Error Messages
- Try to navigate to a non-existing path
- Read the error message carefully
- Understand what Linux is telling you

### Exercise 2: Moving Forward and Backward
- Navigate to different directories
- Use `cd ..` to go back
- Practice with `pwd` to track your location

### Exercise 3: Hidden Files
- Use `ls` to see regular files
- Use `ls -a` to see all files including hidden ones
- Learn to recognize hidden files

## Important Tips

1. **Read error messages** - they tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Use `ls -a`** - to see hidden files
3. **Use `pwd`** - to always know where you are
4. **Practice `cd ..`** - to navigate backwards
5. **Don't be afraid of errors** - they are helpful information!

## Safety Rules

- **Don't delete files** without being sure that's what you want
- **Work in the lab directory** - all exercises are safe here
- **Read carefully** - error messages are your friends

## Lab Submission

After completing all exercises:

1. Create a file called `my_answers.txt` in the lab directory
2. Write short answers to each exercise question
3. Save the file

## Help

If you get stuck:

1. Read the instructions again in the current file
2. Check the command output - it contains important information
3. Use `man` to read about commands (for example: `man cd`)
4. Read error messages carefully - they explain what went wrong

## Good Luck!

Remember: Linux error messages are not trying to confuse you - they're telling you exactly what happened.
Read carefully, practice the commands, and learn from each exercise!
