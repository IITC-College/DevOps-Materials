                            LEVEL 1 SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

EXERCISE 1 - Read a File You Created
-------------------------------------
Commands:
1. cd ~/linux_lab/docs
2. (If file doesn't exist: touch notes.txt && echo "This is a test file for reading practice." > notes.txt)
3. cat notes.txt

Answers:
1. What is displayed?
   The contents of notes.txt are displayed: "This is a test file for reading practice."

2. Does cat stop or continue until the end of the file?
   cat continues and displays the entire file from start to finish without stopping.
   It shows all content at once and returns to the command prompt.

Key Learning: cat displays the entire file contents immediately. It doesn't pause
or wait for user input. For short files, this is convenient. For long files,
it can scroll past too quickly.

EXERCISE 2 - Read a System File
--------------------------------
Commands:
1. cat /etc/hostname

Answers:
What kind of information does this file contain?
The file contains the hostname of the system - the name that identifies this
computer on the network. It's a simple text file with just the hostname,
usually one word like "localhost" or a custom name like "server-01" or
"my-computer".

Key Learning: System files in /etc contain system configuration information.
/etc/hostname is a simple text file that stores the system's hostname.

EXERCISE 3 - Practice with cat
--------------------------------
Commands:
1. cat /etc/os-release
2. cat /etc/hostname /etc/os-release
3. cd ~/linux_reading_files/data/archives
4. cat sample.txt
5. cat nonexistent.txt

Answers:
- What happens when you cat multiple files?
  cat displays all files in sequence, one after another. The output from
  the first file is followed immediately by the output from the second file,
  with no separator between them.

- What error message appears for a non-existent file?
  "cat: nonexistent.txt: No such file or directory"
  This error tells you that the file doesn't exist at the specified path.

Key Learning: cat can read multiple files, displaying them sequentially.
If a file doesn't exist, cat shows a clear error message.

                            LEVEL 2 SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

EXERCISE 1 - Use less to Read a File
-------------------------------------
Commands:
1. less /etc/services
2. (Navigate with arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Space, 'b')
3. (Press 'q' to quit)

Answers:
1. Which key did you use to exit?
   The 'q' key - press 'q' to quit less and return to the command prompt.

2. Why is less useful for large files?
   less is useful for large files because:
   - It allows you to scroll through files page by page
   - You can navigate up and down easily
   - It doesn't dump all content at once (unlike cat)
   - You can search for text within the file
   - It's interactive and gives you control over viewing
   - Much easier to read long files than with cat

Key Learning: less is an interactive pager. It's perfect for files that are
too long to fit on one screen. You can navigate, search, and control the
viewing experience.

EXERCISE 2 - head and tail
---------------------------
Commands:
1. head /etc/services
2. tail /etc/services
3. head -n 5 /etc/services
4. tail -n 5 /etc/services
5. head -n 20 /etc/services
6. tail -n 20 /etc/services

Answers:
What is the difference between head and tail?
head displays the FIRST lines of a file (the beginning), while tail displays
the LAST lines of a file (the end). Both show 10 lines by default, but you
can specify a different number with the -n flag.

- head: Shows lines from the start of the file
- tail: Shows lines from the end of the file
- Both are efficient - they only read the lines they need to display

Key Learning: head and tail are perfect for quick previews. head for seeing
how a file starts, tail for seeing how it ends (especially useful for log files).

EXERCISE 3 - Practice with Lab Files
-------------------------------------
Commands:
1. cd ~/linux_reading_files/data/logs
2. cat long_log.txt (scrolls past quickly)
3. less long_log.txt (interactive navigation)
4. head long_log.txt
5. head -n 15 long_log.txt
6. tail long_log.txt
7. tail -n 15 long_log.txt

Answers:
- When would you use head instead of cat?
  Use head when you only need to see the beginning of a file, especially
  for long files. It's more efficient than cat because it only reads the
  lines it needs to display, and it doesn't scroll past quickly.

- When would you use tail instead of less?
  Use tail when you only need to see the end of a file, especially for
  log files where the most recent entries are at the end. It's faster
  than opening less and scrolling to the end.

Key Learning: Each command has its use case:
- cat: Short files, need entire content
- less: Long files, need to navigate
- head: Quick preview of beginning
- tail: Quick preview of end (great for logs!)

EXERCISE 1 - Permission Denied
-------------------------------
Commands:
1. cat /etc/shadow

Expected Error:
cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied

Answers:
What error message did you receive?
You should receive: "cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied"
or similar error message indicating that you don't have permission to read
this file.

This file contains sensitive password information (password hashes) and is
protected so only the system (root user) can read it. This is a security
feature, not a bug.

Key Learning: Permission denied means you don't have the right to read this
file. Some files are protected for security reasons. This is intentional and
important for system security. Don't try to fix it with sudo unless you
absolutely know what you're doing.

EXERCISE 2 - Advanced Reading Techniques
-----------------------------------------
Commands:
1. cd ~/linux_reading_files/data/logs
2. cat long_log.txt | head -n 5
3. head -n 5 long_log.txt
4. less long_log.txt
5. tail -n 10 long_log.txt
6. cd ../secrets
7. cat tips.txt
8. cd ../archives
9. cat sample.txt

Answers:
- When would you use cat vs less?
  Use cat for short files that fit on one screen (< 50 lines). Use less for
  long files where you need to navigate and search. cat is simpler but less
  gives you more control.

- When would you use head vs tail?
  Use head when you need to see the beginning of a file (headers, file format,
  initial data). Use tail when you need to see the end of a file (recent log
  entries, final results, latest data).

Key Learning: Choose the right tool for the job:
- Short file: cat
- Long file: less
- Need beginning: head
- Need end: tail

EXERCISE 3 - Final Challenge
-----------------------------
Commands (comprehensive example):
1. cd ~/linux_reading_files
2. cat data/secrets/tips.txt
3. head -n 20 data/logs/long_log.txt
4. tail -n 20 data/logs/long_log.txt
5. less data/logs/long_log.txt
6. cat /etc/hostname
7. cat /etc/shadow (will show permission error)

Final Answers:
1. What is the main difference between cat and less?
   cat displays the entire file at once and returns to prompt. less displays
   the file page by page and allows interactive navigation. cat is better for
   short files, less is better for long files.

2. When would you use head instead of cat?
   Use head when you only need to see the beginning of a file, especially
   for long files. It's more efficient and doesn't scroll past quickly.

3. When would you use tail instead of less?
   Use tail when you only need to see the end of a file, especially for
   log files. It's faster than opening less and scrolling to the end.

4. What does "Permission denied" mean?
   Permission denied means you don't have the right to read that file.
   Some files are protected for security reasons and can only be read by
   the system administrator (root user).

5. What did you learn about reading files in Linux?
   (Student's personal reflection - various valid answers about different
   commands, when to use each, error handling, etc.)

                            NOTES FOR INSTRUCTOR
================================================================================

Common Student Mistakes:
1. Trying to use cat on very long files (scrolls past too quickly)
2. Not knowing how to exit less (pressing Ctrl+C instead of 'q')
3. Confusing head and tail
4. Trying to fix permission errors with sudo (shouldn't do this)
5. Not understanding when to use each command

Tips for Helping Students:
- Emphasize that 'q' exits less (not Ctrl+C)
- Show them tail is great for log files
- Explain permission denied is normal for protected files
- Practice with files of different sizes
- Encourage trying all commands on the same file to see differences

Typical Completion Time:
- Fast students: 45-60 minutes
- Average students: 60-75 minutes
- Struggling students: 75-90 minutes

This lab reinforces file reading skills and should be achievable for
all students who understand basic Linux navigation.
