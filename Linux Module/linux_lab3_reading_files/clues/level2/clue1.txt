================================================================================

Welcome to Level 2!

Now let's learn about less - a better way to read long files.

EXERCISE 3 - Use less to Read a File:
--------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Open the following file using less:
   Run: less /etc/services

2. This file is long! Practice scrolling:
   - Use arrow keys (Up/Down) to move line by line
   - Use Page Up / Page Down to move page by page
   - Use Space bar to move forward one page
   - Use 'b' to move backward one page

3. Try searching (optional):
   - Press '/' and type a word to search
   - Press 'n' to find next occurrence

4. Exit less:
   Press 'q' to quit

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- less <file> (open file in less viewer)
- Navigation: Arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Space, 'b'
- Exit: 'q'

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- How does less display the file differently from cat?
- Can you scroll up and down?
- Is it easier to read long files this way?

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After using less, write in my_answers.txt:

1. Which key did you use to exit?
   (The 'q' key - press 'q' to quit less)

2. Why is less useful for large files?
   (less allows you to scroll through files page by page, making it much
   easier to read long files. Unlike cat which displays everything at once,
   less lets you navigate and control the viewing experience.)

Add your answers to my_answers.txt.

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: less is called "less" because it's "more" than the older "more" command!
