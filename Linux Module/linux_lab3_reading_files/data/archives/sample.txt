Sample File for Reading Practice
=================================

This is a sample file that you can use to practice reading files
with different commands.

File Reading Commands:
- cat: Display entire file
- less: View file page by page
- head: Show first lines
- tail: Show last lines

Try reading this file with each command to see the difference!

This file is short, so cat works well here.
For longer files, you might prefer less, head, or tail.

Happy practicing!
