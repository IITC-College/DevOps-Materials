Welcome to the FINAL LEVEL!

This level combines everything you've learned.

THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE:
-----------------------
Find the "Master Key" - a special code hidden across multiple files.

The Master Key consists of 4 parts:

- Part 2: Hidden in project_alpha (search for "PART2")
- Part 3: In a log file from last month (data/logs/backup.log)
- Part 4: In a hidden file somewhere in the projects directory

STRATEGY:
---------
1. Use 'find' to locate files
2. Use 'grep' to search within files
3. Use 'ls -a' to find hidden files
4. Combine all 4 parts in order

Start searching! All the commands you've learned will be useful here.
