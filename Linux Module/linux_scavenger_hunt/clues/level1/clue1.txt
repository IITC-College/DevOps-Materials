Welcome to Level 1!

Your mission: Find the system administrator's password hint.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. The password hint is hidden in a log file
2. The log file is located in the 'data/logs/' directory
3. The file is called 'system.log'
4. Look for a line that contains the word "password"

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- Navigate to the data/logs directory: cd ../../data/logs
- Read the log file: cat system.log
- Or search for the specific word: grep "password" system.log

Once you find the password hint, write it down!

Then proceed to the next clue: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: Use 'ls' to see what other files are in the current directory.
