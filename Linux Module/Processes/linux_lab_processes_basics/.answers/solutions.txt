                    SOLUTIONS - Processes Basics Lab
                    (Instructor use only)
================================================================================

GENERAL:
  Before each clue: run ../../scripts/setup_X_Y.sh (from clues/levelX/)
  After each clue: run ../../scripts/cleanup_X_Y.sh (from clues/levelX/)
  This starts and stops dummy processes per-clue (not throughout the lab).

================================================================================

LEVEL 1 - CLUE 1: "What is a Process?" - Your First Process List
-----------------------------------------------------------------

SETUP (from clues/level1/):
  ../../scripts/setup_1_1.sh
  Starts 1 dummy CPU eater for this clue.

STEP 1 – List processes in simple form, then with detail
  Command:  ps
  Explanation: Shows a short list (often only current terminal).
  
  Command:  ps aux
  Explanation: Shows all processes with PID, USER, %CPU, %MEM, COMMAND. Each
  line is one process. Students see many processes and identify where columns are.

STEP 2 – Observe
  Look at the output. Count roughly how many lines (processes).

STEP 3 – Document
  Write in my_answers.txt: one sentence – how many processes?

CLEANUP (from clues/level1/):
  ../../scripts/cleanup_1_1.sh
  Stops the dummy processes from this clue.

EXAMPLE ANSWER: "ps aux showed roughly 100–200 processes."

================================================================================

LEVEL 1 - CLUE 2: "Where to Look" - PID, User, and Command
----------------------------------------------------------

SETUP (from clues/level1/):
  ../../scripts/setup_1_2.sh
  Starts 1 dummy CPU eater for this clue.

STEP 1 – List all processes with user and command
  Command:  ps aux
  Explanation: First line is column headers. PID (usually column 2), USER
  (column 1), COMMAND (at the end, may be truncated).

STEP 2 – Identify columns and pick one process
  Pick any process (e.g. bash, sshd). Write in my_answers.txt: PID, USER, COMMAND.

CLEANUP (from clues/level1/):
  ../../scripts/cleanup_1_2.sh
  Stops the dummy processes from this clue.

EXAMPLE ANSWER: "PID 1234, USER student, COMMAND bash"

================================================================================

LEVEL 1 - CLUE 3: "Many Processes, One User" - Filtering by User
-----------------------------------------------------------------

SETUP (from clues/level1/):
  ../../scripts/setup_1_3.sh
  Starts 1 dummy CPU eater.

STEP 1 – Find your username
  Command:  whoami

STEP 2 – List only your processes
  Command:  ps aux | grep $USER
  Explanation: Filters to show only your processes. Fewer lines than full ps aux.

STEP 3 – Document
  Write in my_answers.txt: roughly how many processes belong to your user?

CLEANUP (from clues/level1/):
  ../../scripts/cleanup_1_3.sh

EXAMPLE ANSWER: "About 5–15 processes for my user."

================================================================================

LEVEL 2 - CLUE 1: "Live View" - Opening top and Knowing Where to Look
---------------------------------------------------------------------

SETUP (from clues/level2/):
  ../../scripts/setup_2_1.sh
  Ensures dummy processes are running (2 CPU eaters, 1 RAM eater) so they show
  in top as heavy by CPU or by memory.

STEP 1 – Start the live process viewer
  Command:  top
  Explanation: Shows a live-updating list of processes (refreshes every few
  seconds). Unlike ps (snapshot), top shows CPU and memory usage changing.

STEP 2 – Where to look
  Header (top of screen): load average, tasks (total, running, sleeping).
  Process list below: PID, USER, %CPU, %MEM, COMMAND. Numbers update in
  real time.

STEP 3 – Exit
  Action:  press q
  Explanation: Quits top and returns to the shell. Students must exit
  correctly (q, not Ctrl+C as primary habit).

STEP 4 (optional) – Document
  Write in my_answers.txt: one sentence – what did you see in the header and
  in the process list?

EXAMPLE ANSWER: "Header showed load and tasks; process list showed PID,
USER, %CPU, %MEM, COMMAND. I exited with q."

================================================================================

LEVEL 2 - CLUE 2: "Heavy Process" - Finding What Uses CPU or RAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------

SETUP (from clues/level2/):
  ../../scripts/setup_2_2.sh
  Starts 2 CPU eaters + 1 RAM eater.

STEP 1 – Open the live viewer
  Command:  top

STEP 2 – Sort by CPU or memory and find a dummy process
  Action:  inside top, press P (CPU) or M (memory)
  Explanation: Dummy processes appear near top. dummy_cpu_eater = high %CPU,
  dummy_ram_eater = high %MEM.

STEP 3 – Document
  Write in my_answers.txt: PID, USER, %CPU or %MEM.

STEP 4 – Exit
  Action:  press q

CLEANUP (from clues/level2/):
  ../../scripts/cleanup_2_2.sh

EXAMPLE ANSWER: "PID 5678, USER student, %CPU 95 (dummy_cpu_eater)" or "PID 5679, USER student, %MEM 3 (dummy_ram_eater)"

================================================================================

LEVEL 2 - CLUE 3: "htop" - Same Idea, Different Tool (Optional)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

SETUP (from clues/level2/):
  ../../scripts/setup_2_3.sh
  Starts 2 CPU eaters + 1 RAM eater.

STEP 1 – Try htop
  Command:  htop (or skip if not installed)

STEP 2 – If htop runs
  Find one with high CPU or memory. Note PID and USER. Press q to quit.

CLEANUP (from clues/level2/):
  ../../scripts/cleanup_2_3.sh

EXAMPLE ANSWER: "Used htop; found PID 1234, USER student." Or "htop not installed, skipped."

================================================================================

LEVEL 3 - CLUE 1: "Parent and Child" - Processes Have a Parent (PPID)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

SETUP (from clues/level3/):
  ../../scripts/setup_3_1.sh
  Starts 2 CPU eaters + 1 RAM eater.

STEP 1 – List processes with parent PID
  Command:  ps -ef
  Explanation: Shows PID and PPID (Parent Process ID). PPID = the PID of the
  parent process. Process 1 has no parent.

STEP 2 – Find one parent/child pair
  Pick one process. Note PID and PPID. Find the row where PID = that PPID (the parent).

STEP 3 – Document
  Write in my_answers.txt: one parent/child example.

CLEANUP (from clues/level3/):
  ../../scripts/cleanup_3_1.sh

EXAMPLE ANSWER: "PID 1234 has PPID 567; parent is bash."

================================================================================

LEVEL 3 - CLUE 2: "Why a Process Can Eat CPU or RAM"
-----------------------------------------------------

SETUP (from clues/level3/):
  ../../scripts/setup_3_2.sh
  Starts 2 CPU eaters + 1 RAM eater.

STEP 1 – Open top
  Command:  top

STEP 2 – Sort and find a heavy process
  Action:  press P (CPU) or M (memory)
  Explanation: dummy_cpu_eater = high %CPU, dummy_ram_eater = high %MEM.

STEP 3 – Document
  Write: PID and %CPU or %MEM.

STEP 4 – Exit
  Action:  press q

CLEANUP (from clues/level3/):
  ../../scripts/cleanup_3_2.sh

EXAMPLE ANSWER: "dummy_cpu_eater (PID 1234) had %CPU 95."

================================================================================

LEVEL 3 - CLUE 3 (FINAL): "Summary Task" - Put It All Together
----------------------------------------------------------------

SETUP (from clues/level3/):
  ../../scripts/setup_3_3.sh
  Starts 2 CPU eaters + 1 RAM eater.

STEP 1 – Open top and sort by CPU
  Command:  top
  Action:  press P

STEP 2 – Document the top process
  Write in my_answers.txt: "Top CPU process: PID ___, USER ___, %CPU ___, COMMAND ___"

STEP 3 – Exit
  Action:  press q

STEP 4 (optional) – Verify with snapshot
  Command:  ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -5

CLEANUP (from clues/level3/):
  ../../scripts/cleanup_3_3.sh
  Stops the dummy processes from this clue. No end_lab.sh needed; each clue
  cleans up after itself.

EXAMPLE ANSWER: "Top CPU process: PID 1234, USER student, %CPU 95, COMMAND dummy_cpu_eater.sh."
