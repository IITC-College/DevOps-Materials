                    TIPS - Where to Look in top / htop
================================================================================

This lab uses dummy processes: dummy_cpu_eater and dummy_cpu_eater2 (high
%CPU), dummy_ram_eater (high %MEM). Before each clue run setup_X_Y.sh; after
each clue run cleanup_X_Y.sh (paths in the clue). Find them by sorting in
top (P = CPU, M = memory) or by name in COMMAND column.

You don't need to understand every line. You need to know WHERE TO LOOK.

IN top (and htop):
-----------------
1. HEADER (top of screen):
   - Load average: how busy the system is (1 min, 5 min, 15 min)
   - Tasks: total, running, sleeping, etc.
   You don't need to memorize these – just know they're there.

2. PROCESS LIST (below the header):
   - PID    = Process ID (unique number)
   - USER   = Who is running this process
   - %CPU   = How much CPU this process is using
   - %MEM   = How much memory (RAM) this process is using
   - COMMAND (or CMD) = The program name

3. TO FIND A "HEAVY" PROCESS:
   - Look at %CPU and %MEM. High values = process is "eating" that resource.
   - Press P (capital P) inside top to sort by CPU (highest first).
   - Press M (capital M) inside top to sort by memory (highest first).

4. TO EXIT:
   - Press q (for quit). That's it!
