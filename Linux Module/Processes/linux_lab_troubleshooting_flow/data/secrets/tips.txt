# Troubleshooting Flow Lab – Optional Tips

- Your deliverable is investigation_report.txt at the lab root: one block per scenario (Service/Process name, Status, Relevant log line, Action performed, Short conclusion). Use submission_template.txt to copy the format.
- Always run SETUP before a clue and CLEANUP when done, so the scenario is correct and the next clue is clean.
- Process = something you see with ps (or top). Service = something systemd knows about (systemctl --user list-units --type=service).
- For "not running": if it's a process, use ps aux | grep <name>. If it's a service, use systemctl --user status <unit>.
- For services, logs are in the journal: journalctl --user -u <unit> -n 20 (last 20 lines).
- For process-only scenarios, logs may be in the lab's data/logs/ directory (e.g. lab_helper.log).
- Next action: start (systemctl --user start, or run the script in background), restart (systemctl --user restart), kill (kill <PID>), or report what you found.
