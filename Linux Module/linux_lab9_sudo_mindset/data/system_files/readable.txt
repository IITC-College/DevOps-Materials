This is a readable file that doesn't require sudo.

It's owned by a regular user and has standard permissions that allow
anyone to read it. This demonstrates that not all files require sudo
to access.

Key points:
- This file has standard permissions (644 typically)
- It's owned by a regular user, not root
- You can read it without sudo
- This is the normal case for user files

Remember: If you can read a file without sudo, that's usually the
correct way to do it!
