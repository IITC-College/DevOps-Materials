                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 1
                    "Permission Denied: To sudo or Not to sudo?"
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 1!

Your first exercise: Encountering a "Permission denied" error and learning
when sudo is actually appropriate.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
In Linux, when you get "Permission denied", your first instinct might be to
use sudo. But that's not always the right solution! Sometimes the problem is
that you need to fix permissions or ownership, not elevate privileges.

The key is to UNDERSTAND why you got "Permission denied" before deciding
what to do about it.

EXERCISE:
---------
You'll encounter a protected file and learn to analyze the situation before
using sudo.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the data/system_files directory:
   cd ../../data/system_files

2. Try to read the protected.txt file:
   cat protected.txt

3. You'll get "Permission denied" - this is expected!

4. Check the file permissions to understand WHY:
   ls -l protected.txt

5. Notice:
   - Who owns the file? (Look at the owner column)
   - What are the permissions? (Look at the permission string)
   - Why can't you read it?

6. Now use sudo to read it (this is appropriate here):
   sudo cat protected.txt

7. Observe the difference - sudo allows you to read it because it elevates
   your privileges to root level.

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd ../../data/system_files
- cat protected.txt (will fail first time)
- ls -l protected.txt
- sudo cat protected.txt (should work!)

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- What error message appears when you try to read without sudo?
- Who owns the protected.txt file?
- What are the file permissions?
- Why can't you read it without sudo?
- What happens when you use sudo cat?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
In this case, sudo is appropriate because:
- The file is owned by root (system file)
- It contains system information that requires elevated privileges
- You're reading it, not modifying it
- This is a legitimate administrative operation

However, remember: Not every "Permission denied" requires sudo. Sometimes
the solution is to fix ownership or permissions instead!

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- What error message did you see when trying to read protected.txt?
- Who owns the protected.txt file?
- What are the file permissions?
- Why was sudo needed in this case?
- What did the file contain?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: The key is understanding WHY you got "Permission denied" before
deciding whether sudo is the right solution!
