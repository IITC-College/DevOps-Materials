                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 3
                    "Reading System Files: When sudo is Required"
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 3!

Now you'll encounter a real system file that requires sudo. This will help
you understand why certain files are protected and when sudo is legitimate.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
Linux protects certain system files because they contain sensitive information
or control critical system behavior. These files are owned by root and have
restrictive permissions.

Examples of protected system files:
- /etc/shadow - Contains encrypted passwords
- /etc/sudoers - Controls sudo access
- /root - Root user's home directory
- /etc/passwd - User account information

These files require sudo to read because they contain sensitive system data.

EXERCISE:
---------
You'll try to read a system file and understand why sudo is required.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Try to read the /etc/shadow file (this will fail):
   cat /etc/shadow

2. You'll get "Permission denied" - this is expected and CORRECT!

3. Check the file permissions:
   ls -l /etc/shadow

4. Notice:
   - Who owns this file? (root)
   - What are the permissions? (Very restrictive - only root can read)
   - Why is this file protected? (Contains encrypted passwords)

5. Now use sudo to read it (this is legitimate for learning):
   sudo cat /etc/shadow

6. Observe the file contents - notice it contains encrypted password hashes.
   This is why it's protected!

7. Also try to list the /root directory:
   ls /root

8. You'll get "Permission denied" - check why:
   ls -l /root

9. Use sudo to list it:
   sudo ls /root

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cat /etc/shadow (will fail - expected!)
- ls -l /etc/shadow
- sudo cat /etc/shadow (should work)
- ls /root (will fail)
- ls -l /root
- sudo ls /root (should work)

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- Why is /etc/shadow protected?
- What information does it contain?
- Why can't regular users read it?
- What happens when you use sudo?
- Why is /root directory protected?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
System files are protected because:
- They contain sensitive information (passwords, system configs)
- They control critical system behavior
- Unauthorized access could compromise system security
- They should only be accessed by administrators

sudo is legitimate here because:
- You're reading system files for educational purposes
- You're not modifying anything
- This is a controlled learning environment
- Understanding system files is part of Linux administration

However, in production:
- Be very careful with sudo
- Only use it when absolutely necessary
- Understand what you're doing
- Remember: sudo usage is logged!

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- Why is /etc/shadow protected?
- What type of information does /etc/shadow contain?
- Why can't regular users read /root directory?
- When is it legitimate to use sudo to read system files?
- What's the security reason for protecting these files?

Then proceed to Level 2: cd ../level2

Hint: System files are protected for good reasons - security! sudo allows
administrators to access them when needed, but this access is logged and
monitored.

================================================================================
                    LEVEL 1 COMPLETE - CONGRATULATIONS!
================================================================================

You've learned:
- How to analyze "Permission denied" errors
- When sudo is actually needed
- Why system files are protected
- The difference between user-level and system-level operations

Now move on to Level 2 to learn about alternatives to sudo and audit logging!
