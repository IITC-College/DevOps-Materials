COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- Think and reflect!
- Write your answers in my_answers.txt
- Review the lab materials if needed

WHAT TO REFLECT ON:
-------------------
- The difference between legitimate sudo use and design problems
- The importance of audit logging
- The principle of fixing root causes
- The responsibility that comes with sudo
- Critical thinking about privilege elevation
- Security implications of sudo usage

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
Key takeaways from this lab:

1. **"Permission denied" ≠ "Use sudo"**
   - Analyze first, then decide
   - Consider alternatives
   - Fix root causes when possible

2. **sudo is for administrative tasks**
   - System-level operations
   - One-time fixes
   - Not for working around bad design

3. **sudo is logged**
   - Every command is tracked
   - You are accountable
   - Audit trails are important

4. **Fix, don't work around**
   - Use sudo to fix ownership/permissions
   - Don't use sudo repeatedly for the same thing
   - Solve the root cause

5. **Think critically**
   - Ask: "Is this really an administrative task?"
   - Consider: "Is there a better solution?"
   - Remember: "sudo is powerful - use it wisely"

WRITE YOUR REFLECTION:
----------------------
Create or edit my_answers.txt in the lab root directory and write:

1. Answers to all 6 reflection questions (detailed)
2. A summary paragraph about what you learned
3. Any questions or areas for further exploration
4. Your thoughts on sudo responsibility

This reflection is important - it helps solidify your learning!
