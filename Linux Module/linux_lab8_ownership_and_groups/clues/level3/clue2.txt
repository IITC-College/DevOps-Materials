                            LEVEL 3 - EXERCISE 2
    "Team Projects and Shared Groups" - Collaboration Through Groups
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 3, Exercise 2!

Your task: Understand how teams use groups to share files in collaborative projects.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
In team environments, files are often shared through groups:
- Individual files are owned by team members (owner=person who created it)
- Files belong to a shared group (group=team name, like "developers")
- Group permissions allow all team members to access files
- This enables collaboration without making files world-readable

This is the standard pattern: owner=individual, group=team, permissions=group access.

EXERCISE:
---------
Examine a shared team project and understand the ownership pattern.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the shared team project:
   
   cd ../shared_team

2. List files with detailed information:
   
   ls -l

3. Check who owns each file:
   - Look at the owner column
   - Look at the group column

4. Check which groups you belong to:
   
   groups

5. Determine:
   - Are you a member of the project's group?
   - What are the group permissions?
   - Can you access files based on group membership?

6. Read one of the team files:
   
   cat team_notes.txt

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd ../shared_team
- ls -l
- groups
- cat team_notes.txt

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- Who owns the files in shared_team?
- What group do the files belong to?
- Are you a member of that group? (check with `groups`)
- What are the group permissions?
- Can you read/write files based on group membership?
- How does this enable team collaboration?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
Team collaboration pattern:
- Owner: Individual team member who created/modified the file
- Group: Shared team group (e.g., "developers", "team-alpha")
- Permissions: Group has read/write access (e.g., `rwxrwx---`)

This pattern enables:
- Team members can read/write shared files (via group permissions)
- Files aren't world-readable (security)
- Individual ownership is tracked (who created/modified)
- New team members join the group to get access

Example:
- File: `-rwxrwx--- alice developers project.txt`
- Alice owns it, developers group has access
- Any member of "developers" group can read/write
- Others cannot access (other permissions are `---`)

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After examining the shared team project, write in my_answers.txt:
- What is the ownership pattern for team files? (owner:group format)
- How do groups enable team collaboration?
- Why is this better than making files world-readable?
- In your own words, explain the pattern: owner=individual, group=team.
- How would a new team member get access to these files?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue3.txt in this same directory.

Hint: Groups are the key to team collaboration! Files owned by the team group
allow all team members to access them, while keeping files secure from others.
