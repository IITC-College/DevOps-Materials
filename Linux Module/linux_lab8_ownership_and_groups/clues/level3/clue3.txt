                            LEVEL 3 - EXERCISE 3
        "Complete Ownership Challenge" - Putting It All Together
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 3, Exercise 3 - The Final Challenge!

Your task: Apply everything you've learned to fix ownership issues in a
complex scenario.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
In real DevOps work, you'll encounter files with various ownership issues:
- Files owned by wrong users
- Files in wrong groups
- Files that need ownership changes for services
- Mixed ownership in project directories

Your job is to analyze, understand, and fix these issues using chown.

EXERCISE:
---------
Navigate through multiple directories, identify ownership issues, and fix them.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Check who you are:
   
   whoami

2. Check your groups:
   
   groups

3. Navigate to the database project:
   
   cd ../database

4. List files and examine ownership:
   
   ls -l

5. For each file, determine:
   - Who owns it?
   - What group does it belong to?
   - Should it be owned differently? (read README if available)
   - Do you have access? Why or why not?

6. If ownership needs to be fixed, use chown:
   
   sudo chown mysql:mysql backup.sql

7. Verify the change:
   
   ls -l backup.sql

8. Navigate to other project directories and repeat the analysis:
   
   cd ../web_app
   ls -l
   # Analyze and fix as needed
   
   cd ../shared_team
   ls -l
   # Analyze and fix as needed

9. Document your findings and fixes

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- whoami
- groups
- cd ../database (and other directories)
- ls -l
- sudo chown user:group filename (as needed)
- cat README.md (if available)

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- What ownership issues do you find?
- Which files should be owned by service users (mysql, www-data)?
- Which files should be owned by you?
- Which files should be in shared groups?
- After fixing ownership, can you access files correctly?
- Did the ownership changes solve access problems?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
Ownership fixes follow patterns:
- Service files → owned by service user (mysql:mysql, www-data:www-data)
- Personal files → owned by you (youruser:yourgroup)
- Team files → owned by team member, group=team (alice:developers)
- Config files → owned by service that needs them

Always verify with `ls -l` after chown!

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the challenge, write in my_answers.txt:
- List 3 ownership issues you found and fixed
- For each fix, explain WHY the ownership needed to change
- What pattern did you notice for service files (web, database)?
- What pattern did you notice for team files?
- In your own words, summarize when and why you would use chown in real work.
- What is the most important thing you learned about ownership in this lab?

Congratulations! You've completed the Ownership and Groups lab!

Hint: Ownership is about WHO can access files. Understanding ownership helps
you fix access problems, secure systems, and enable collaboration. Always
check ownership with `ls -l` before and after using chown!
