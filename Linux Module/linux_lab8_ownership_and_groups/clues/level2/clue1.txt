                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 1
            "Ownership Blocking Access" - When Owner Matters More
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 2!

Your task: Understand how ownership can block access, even when permissions
seem to allow it.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
Sometimes a file has permissions that look like they should allow access, but
you still can't access it. Why? Because ownership matters! Even if a file has
`rwx` permissions, if you're not the owner AND not in the group, you only get
the "other" permissions - which might be `---` (no access).

EXERCISE:
---------
Try to access a file owned by root and understand why access is blocked.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Check who you are:
   
   whoami

2. Navigate to the data/files directory:
   
   cd ../../data/files

3. List files with detailed information:
   
   ls -l

4. Look for a file that might be owned by root or another user

5. Try to read that file:
   
   cat root_file.txt

6. Observe what happens - do you get "Permission denied"?

7. Check the permissions and ownership:
   
   ls -l root_file.txt

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- whoami
- cd ../../data/files
- ls -l
- cat root_file.txt (may fail)
- ls -l root_file.txt

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- Who owns root_file.txt? (check ls -l output)
- Are you the owner? (compare to your username)
- What are the permissions? (rwxrwxrwx format)
- What are the "other" permissions? (the last rwx)
- Can you read the file? Why or why not?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
Even if a file has permissions like `-rw-r--r--`, the ownership determines
which permission set applies to you:

- If file is owned by `root` and you're `student`:
  - You're NOT the owner → owner permissions don't apply
  - You're NOT in root's group → group permissions don't apply
  - You get "other" permissions → which might be `r--` (read only) or `---` (no access)

This is why ownership is so important - it's the first check Linux makes!

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After examining the file, write in my_answers.txt:
- Who owns root_file.txt?
- Are you the owner? (yes/no)
- What are the "other" permissions for this file?
- Can you read the file? Why or why not?
- In your own words, explain why ownership can block access even when permissions
  seem to allow it.

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: Ownership is the FIRST check - Linux asks "Are you the owner?" before
checking permissions. If you're not the owner, you only get "other" permissions!
