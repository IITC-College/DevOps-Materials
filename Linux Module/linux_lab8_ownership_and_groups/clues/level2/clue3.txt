                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 3
            "Changing Ownership" - Using chown to Fix Ownership
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 2, Exercise 3!

Your task: Learn to change file ownership using the `chown` command.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
Sometimes you need to change who owns a file. For example:
- A file was created by root but should be owned by you
- A file needs to be transferred to another user
- You're fixing ownership after a deployment

The command is `chown`, but it requires `sudo` because only root can change
ownership. This is a security feature - regular users can't steal ownership
of files!

EXERCISE:
---------
Try to change ownership without sudo (it will fail), then use sudo to change it.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Check who you are:
   
   whoami

2. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   
   cd ../../scripts

3. List files to see their current ownership:
   
   ls -l

4. Try to change ownership WITHOUT sudo (this will fail):
   
   chown $(whoami):$(whoami) check_owner.sh

5. Observe the error message - what does it say?

6. Now use sudo to change ownership:
   
   sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) check_owner.sh

7. Verify the change worked:
   
   ls -l check_owner.sh

8. Notice that the owner changed to your username!

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- whoami
- cd ../../scripts
- ls -l
- chown $(whoami):$(whoami) check_owner.sh (will fail)
- sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) check_owner.sh
- ls -l check_owner.sh

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- What error message do you get when trying chown without sudo?
- Why do you think chown requires sudo?
- After using sudo chown, who owns the file now?
- What does the format `user:group` mean in chown?
- What does `$(whoami)` do? (It runs the whoami command and uses the result)

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
The `chown` command changes file ownership:
- Format: `chown user:group filename`
- `user` is the new owner (username or UID)
- `group` is the new group (groupname or GID)
- Requires `sudo` because only root can change ownership (security!)

Why sudo is required:
- Prevents users from stealing ownership of files
- Prevents users from giving away files they don't own
- Only root (or users with sudo) can change ownership

The `$(whoami)` syntax:
- Runs the `whoami` command
- Uses the output (your username) in the chown command
- Equivalent to typing your username directly

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- What error message did you get when trying chown without sudo?
- Why do you think chown requires sudo? (security reason)
- Who owned check_owner.sh before chown?
- Who owns it after chown?
- What does the format `user:group` mean in chown?
- In your own words, explain when you might need to use chown in real work.

Then proceed to Level 3: cd ../../clues/level3

Hint: chown is powerful but requires sudo for security. Always verify ownership
changes with `ls -l` after using chown!
