                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 3
            "Owner vs Group vs Other" - Which Permissions Apply?
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 1, Exercise 3!

Your task: Understand when owner, group, or other permissions apply to you.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
Linux has three sets of permissions for every file:
- Owner permissions (what the owner can do)
- Group permissions (what group members can do)
- Other permissions (what everyone else can do)

But which set applies to YOU? It depends on:
1. Are you the owner? → Owner permissions apply
2. Are you in the group? → Group permissions apply
3. Otherwise → Other permissions apply

Only ONE set applies - Linux checks in this order!

EXERCISE:
---------
Examine files with different permission patterns and understand which set applies.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. First, check who you are:
   
   whoami

2. Check which groups you belong to:
   
   groups

3. Navigate to the data/files directory:
   
   cd ../../data/files

4. List files with detailed information:
   
   ls -l

5. For each file, determine:
   - Are you the owner? (compare to your username from `whoami`)
   - Are you in the group? (compare to your groups from `groups`)
   - Which permission set applies to you?

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- whoami
- groups
- cd ../../data/files
- ls -l

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- Which files are you the owner of?
- Which files have groups you belong to?
- For files you own: which permission set applies? (owner/group/other)
- For files in your groups: which permission set applies?
- For files you don't own and aren't in the group: which permission set applies?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
Linux checks permissions in this order:
1. Are you the owner? → Use owner permissions (rwx)
2. Are you in the group? → Use group permissions (rwx)
3. Otherwise → Use other permissions (rwx)

Example:
- File: `-rwxr-x--- user1 developers file.txt`
- If you ARE `user1` → You get `rwx` (owner permissions)
- If you're IN `developers` group → You get `r-x` (group permissions)
- Otherwise → You get `---` (other permissions = no access!)

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After examining the files, write in my_answers.txt:
- For a file you own: which permission set applies to you? Why?
- For a file in a group you belong to: which permission set applies? Why?
- For a file you don't own and aren't in the group: which permission set applies? Why?
- In your own words, explain the order Linux checks permissions (owner → group → other)

Then proceed to Level 2: cd ../../clues/level2

Hint: Remember - Linux checks owner FIRST, then group, then other. Only ONE
set of permissions applies to you, based on your relationship to the file!
