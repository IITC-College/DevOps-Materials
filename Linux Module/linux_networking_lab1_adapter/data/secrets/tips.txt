                        NETWORKING DEBUG TIPS
================================================================================

If you're stuck, remember:

1. READ THE ERROR MESSAGE - It tells you what layer is broken!
   - "Network is unreachable" → Routing/gateway issue
   - "No route to host" → Routing issue
   - "Connection refused" → Service not running or firewall
   - "Connection timed out" → Firewall blocking or host down
   - "Name or service not known" → DNS issue

2. WORK FROM THE BOTTOM UP - The OSI/TCP-IP model:
   Layer 1-2: Is the interface UP? (ip link show)
   Layer 3: Do you have an IP? (ip addr show)
   Layer 3: Do you have a route? (ip route)
   Layer 4+: Is the firewall blocking? (ufw status)
   Layer 7: Is DNS working? (nslookup)

3. COMPARE WHAT WORKS VS WHAT DOESN'T:
   - Ping by IP works but by name fails? → DNS problem
   - Local ping works but internet fails? → Gateway/routing
   - Small pings work but large fail? → MTU issue
   - One destination fails but others work? → Specific route

4. KEY DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS:
   ip link show           # Interface state
   ip addr show           # IP addresses
   ip route               # Routing table
   ip route get <dest>    # How would this be routed?
   cat /etc/resolv.conf   # DNS servers
   cat /etc/hosts         # Local name overrides
   sudo ufw status        # Firewall rules
   ping -c 2 <host>       # Basic connectivity
   ping -s 1000 <host>    # Large packet test
   traceroute <host>      # Path to destination

5. THE 4-STEP PROCESS:
   OBSERVE → INSPECT → DIAGNOSE → RESOLVE
   Don't skip steps! Gather evidence before fixing.

6. COMMON FIXES:
   Interface down:    sudo ip link set <iface> up
   No IP:            sudo dhclient <iface>
   No gateway:       sudo ip route add default via <gw>
   Bad DNS:          Edit /etc/resolv.conf
   UFW blocking:     sudo ufw allow <port or service>
   Bad MTU:          sudo ip link set <iface> mtu 1500
   Bad route:        sudo ip route del <bad route>
   Bad hosts entry:  Edit /etc/hosts

7. VERIFY AFTER EVERY FIX:
   - Re-run your diagnostic command
   - Test the original failing operation
   - Don't assume it worked - prove it!
