# Script Basics Lab - Optional Tips

## Clue 1 (First script)
- You can use nano, vim, or any text editor. nano is simple: type, Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to exit.
- Run from projects/: bash first_deploy.sh

## Clue 2 (Shebang)
- The shebang must be the FIRST line of the file. No blank line or comment before it.
- After adding shebang, ./first_deploy.sh will still fail until you add execute permission (Level 2).

## Clue 3 (Why it didn't run)
- ls -l shows: permissions, owner, group, size, date, filename. Focus on the first column (e.g. -rw-r--r--).

## Level 2 Clue 1 (Checking permissions)
- rwx = read, write, execute. If you see -rw-r--r--, there is no x for anyone.
- sample_script.sh is in data/configs/ and has execute permission so you can compare.

## Level 2 Clue 2 (chmod +x)
- chmod +x first_deploy.sh adds execute for owner (and often group/others depending on umask).
- After chmod +x, ./first_deploy.sh should work from the projects/ directory.

## Level 2 Clue 3 (Two ways to run)
- ./script.sh: kernel reads shebang, runs /bin/bash with script. Requires execute permission.
- bash script.sh: you run bash; script is just an argument. No execute permission needed on the script.
