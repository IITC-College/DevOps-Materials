# Mini DevOps Tool Lab - Optional Tips

## Level 1 Clue 1 (case menu)
- case "$ACTION" in check) check_services ;; status) show_status ;; backup) backup_now ;; pipeline) run_pipeline ;; exit) echo "Exiting."; exit 0 ;; *) echo "Error: ..."; exit 1 ;; esac
- Each branch calls a function; *) handles invalid input and exits 1.

## Level 1 Clue 2 (show_status)
- Use date, uptime -p (or uptime), df -h ., free -h. Use 2>/dev/null and fallbacks (e.g. "df not available") so script doesn't fail if a command is missing.

## Level 1 Clue 3 (check_services)
- for SVC in nginx app db; do echo "  Checking $SVC..."; echo "    $SVC: OK"; done – at least one loop in the script.

## Level 2 Clue 1 (backup_now, exit 0)
- backup_now() echoes backup path and steps. Add exit 0 after each successful case branch (check, status, backup, pipeline, exit) so script returns 0; *) keeps exit 1.

## Level 2 Clue 2 (run_pipeline)
- run_pipeline() echoes validate -> build -> test -> deploy (simulated). Pipeline branch already calls it and exits 0.

## Level 2 Clue 3 (checklist)
- One loop: check_services for. One function: multiple (check_services, show_status, backup_now, run_pipeline). One case. Clear output. exit 0 on success, exit 1 on invalid.
