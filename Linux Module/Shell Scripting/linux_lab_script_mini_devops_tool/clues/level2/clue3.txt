                    LEVEL 2 - CLUE 3
            "Final Checklist" - One Loop, One Function, case, exit 0/1
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You'll verify the script meets the capstone (and home lab) requirements:
(1) at least one loop, (2) at least one function, (3) one case menu,
(4) clear output, (5) exit 0 on success and exit 1 on invalid input.
Then document what you would add for a real environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Review ops_tool.sh. Confirm:
   - At least one loop: check_services has a for loop over nginx, app, db.
   - At least one function: check_services, show_status, backup_now, run_pipeline.
   - One case menu: case "$ACTION" in check|status|backup|pipeline|exit|*).
   - Clear output: timestamps, labels, blank lines where needed.
   - exit 0 after each valid action, exit 1 in the *) branch.

2. Run the script once with check, once with status, once with invalid.
   Confirm output is clear and exit codes are 0, 0, 1.

3. Write in my_answers.txt (lab root): one sentence – what would you add
   for a real environment? (e.g. "Real health checks (curl or systemctl),
   real backup paths and tar/cp, real pipeline steps that run build/test
   scripts and check their exit codes.")

                    LAB COMPLETE
================================================================================
Congratulations! You've completed the Mini DevOps Tool capstone. You have
built a script that combines: case menu, functions, a loop, system commands
(date, uptime, df, free), and reliable exit codes – a small operational
tool you can rely on and plug into CI/CD later.
