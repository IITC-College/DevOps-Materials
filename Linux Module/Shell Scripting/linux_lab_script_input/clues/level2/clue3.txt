                    LEVEL 2 - CLUE 3
            "Document Your Findings" - What Happens with Empty Input?
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You've seen that read stores whatever the user types – including nothing.
When they press Enter without typing, the variable is empty. Documenting
this helps you remember why validation is needed later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. In my_answers.txt (lab root), add a short summary (2–3 sentences) under
   a heading "Empty input findings":
   - What did the script print when you entered nothing?
   - What would you want the script to do instead? (e.g. print "Error: service
     name cannot be empty" and exit – you'll learn how in the conditionals lab.)

2. Run check_service.sh one more time with a real service name (e.g. web).
   Confirm it still works when input is provided. That's the behavior we want
   to keep – and add a check for empty input in a later lab.

3. You've completed the Input lab. You can use read and read -p, echo back
   input, and you understand why empty input is a problem.

                    LAB COMPLETE
================================================================================
Congratulations! You've completed the Script Input lab. You can read user
input, use read -p for prompts, and you understand why validation matters.
