# Script Input Lab - Optional Tips

## Level 1 Clue 1 (read)
- read -p "Enter service name: " SERVICE  (prompt and variable in one line)
- echo "Checking service: $SERVICE"

## Level 1 Clue 2 (read -p)
- setup_1_2.sh starts a dummy "web" service – you're practicing read/echo, not actually checking the process.
- read -p shows the prompt on the same line; plain read doesn't show a prompt (you have to echo first).

## Level 1 Clue 3 (empty input)
- If you press Enter without typing, SERVICE is empty. The script will echo "Checking service: " and "Will check status of  now."

## Level 2 Clue 1 (observe empty input)
- setup_2_1.sh starts a dummy "database" service. Run check_service.sh and press Enter without typing to see empty input behavior.

## Level 2 Clue 2–3 (validation thinking)
- We don't fix the script here – that's the conditionals lab. Here you document why validation matters.
