# Script Loops Lab - Optional Tips

## Level 1 Clue 1 (for over list)
- for DIR in project1 project2 logs; do ... done – DIR takes each value in turn.
- Quote variables in conditions: [ -d "$DIR" ].

## Level 1 Clue 2 (loop over dirs, check existence)
- From projects/, ../ is lab root. So ../data/environments/$DIR is data/environments/project1 etc.
- data/environments/ has project1 and logs (no project2) so you'll see "exists" for project1 and logs, "missing" for project2.

## Level 1 Clue 3 (list from file)
- for PATHNAME in $(cat ../data/configs/paths.txt); do ... – each line becomes one iteration (watch out for spaces in lines).
- Variable: PATHS="logs config backup"; for P in $PATHS; do ... – same idea.

## Level 2 Clue 1 (while counter)
- COUNT=$((COUNT+1)) – arithmetic in bash; no spaces around = in assignment.
- -le = less or equal; when COUNT becomes 4, [ 4 -le 3 ] is false, loop exits.

## Level 2 Clue 2 (retry pattern)
- break exits the loop immediately. Without break, all 3 attempts run.
- Real retry: run a command (e.g. curl), check $?, break if 0, else ATTEMPT=$((ATTEMPT+1)).

## Level 2 Clue 3 (combine for and while)
- Outer for DIR; inner while ATTEMPT; check [ -d "../data/environments/$DIR" ]; break on success.
