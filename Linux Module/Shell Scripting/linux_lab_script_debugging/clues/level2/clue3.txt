                    LEVEL 2 - CLUE 3
            "Complete CI Script" - Multiple Bugs in One Script
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Real scripts often have more than one bug. You'll fix a CI script that
combines several mistakes: wrong assignment, missing quotes, wrong path,
missing then or fi. Find and fix all of them so the script runs correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. From scripts/, run: bash ci_full_broken.sh
   Note every error message (or wrong output). The script is supposed to:
   set APP_NAME, check for a config file, and echo "CI build complete."

2. Open ci_full_broken.sh. Fix each bug you find:
   - Spaces in variable assignment (APP_NAME = "myapp" → APP_NAME="myapp")
   - Missing quotes in [ -f $CONFIG ] → [ -f "$CONFIG" ]
   - Wrong path: CONFIG should point to ../data/configs/ci_config.txt
   - Missing "then" after if [ ... ]
   - Missing "fi" to close the if
   Save after each fix and run until the script runs without errors and
   prints "CI build complete."

3. Write in my_answers.txt: a short list of the bugs you found and how you
   fixed them (one line per bug).
