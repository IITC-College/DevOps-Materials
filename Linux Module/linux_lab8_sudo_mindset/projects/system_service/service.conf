# System Service Configuration

This is a system service configuration file.

It would typically be installed to /etc/my-service/service.conf and
would require sudo to modify.

Key points:
- System services affect the entire system
- They require administrative privileges
- sudo is legitimate for system administration
- This is different from user applications

This demonstrates legitimate sudo use for system-level operations.
