# User Application Configuration

This is a configuration file for a user application.

It should be owned by the user, not root. Currently it's owned by root
(by design for the lab exercise), but in a real scenario, this would
be a design problem.

Key points:
- User applications should be owned by the user
- You shouldn't need sudo to read your own config files
- If you need sudo repeatedly, fix the ownership instead

After fixing ownership with `sudo chown $USER:$USER config.txt`, you
can read this file normally without sudo.
