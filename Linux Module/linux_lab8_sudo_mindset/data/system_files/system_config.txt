This is a system configuration file that requires sudo to read.

System configuration files are typically located in /etc/ and contain
settings that affect the entire system. These files are protected
because modifying them incorrectly could break the system.

Examples of system config files:
- /etc/hosts - Hostname resolution
- /etc/passwd - User account information
- /etc/nginx/nginx.conf - Web server configuration
- /etc/ssh/sshd_config - SSH server configuration

Key points:
- System config files are owned by root
- They have restrictive permissions
- They require sudo to read or modify
- This is legitimate sudo use

When is it appropriate to use sudo for system configs?
- Reading for administrative purposes
- Modifying system settings
- Troubleshooting system issues

Remember: Always backup system configs before modifying them!
