This is a protected system file that requires sudo to read.

It contains sensitive system information that should only be accessible
to administrators. This file is owned by root and has restrictive
permissions (typically 600 or 640).

Key points:
- This file is owned by root
- It has restrictive permissions
- Regular users cannot read it without sudo
- This is intentional for security

This type of file requires sudo because:
1. It contains sensitive information
2. It's part of system configuration
3. Only administrators should access it
4. It's protected by design

Remember: When you use sudo to read this file, your action is logged
in the audit trail!
