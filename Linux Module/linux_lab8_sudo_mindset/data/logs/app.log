This is a regular application log file. It doesn't require sudo to read
because it's owned by a regular user and has standard permissions.

Key points:
- Application logs are typically readable by the application owner
- They don't require sudo unless owned by root
- This is normal for user applications
- System logs (in /var/log) may require sudo
