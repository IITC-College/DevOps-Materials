                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 1
                    "Discovering sudo Alternatives: Fix, Don't Work Around"
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 2!

Now you'll learn an important lesson: sudo should be used to FIX problems,
not to work around them repeatedly. If you find yourself using sudo for the
same file over and over, there's probably a better solution!

BACKGROUND:
-----------
Many people use `sudo cat` or `sudo vim` every time they need to access a
file. But if you need regular access to a file, it's better to fix the
ownership or permissions ONCE, rather than using sudo repeatedly.

The principle: Use sudo to FIX the problem (change ownership/permissions),
not to work around it (using sudo every time).

EXERCISE:
---------
You'll encounter files that are owned by root but should belong to you.
Instead of using sudo every time, you'll fix the ownership once.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the projects/user_app directory:
   cd ../../projects/user_app

2. Try to read the config.txt file:
   cat config.txt

3. You'll get "Permission denied" - check why:
   ls -l config.txt

4. Notice: The file is owned by root, but it's YOUR application config!
   This is a design problem - it should be owned by you.

5. Instead of using `sudo cat config.txt` every time, let's FIX it:
   sudo chown $USER:$USER config.txt

6. Check the ownership now:
   ls -l config.txt

7. Now try to read it WITHOUT sudo:
   cat config.txt

8. It works! You fixed the problem once, now you don't need sudo anymore.

9. Try the same with install.sh:
   ls -l install.sh
   sudo chown $USER:$USER install.sh
   cat install.sh

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd ../../projects/user_app
- cat config.txt (will fail first time)
- ls -l config.txt
- sudo chown $USER:$USER config.txt (fix ownership)
- ls -l config.txt (verify change)
- cat config.txt (should work now without sudo!)
- ls -l install.sh
- sudo chown $USER:$USER install.sh
- cat install.sh

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- Why did you get "Permission denied" initially?
- Who owned the file before fixing?
- What command fixed the ownership?
- Can you read it now without sudo?
- What's the difference between fixing ownership vs using sudo repeatedly?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
The key principle:
- **BAD**: Using `sudo cat file.txt` every time you need to read it
- **GOOD**: Using `sudo chown user:user file.txt` ONCE, then reading it normally

Why is this better?
- You only need sudo once (to fix the problem)
- After that, you can work normally without sudo
- It's more secure (less privilege elevation)
- It's the correct solution (fix the root cause)

When to use this approach:
- Files that should belong to you but are owned by root
- Files you need to access regularly
- User application files (not system files!)

When NOT to use this approach:
- System files that should be owned by root
- Files that are intentionally protected
- Files that multiple users need to access

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- Why did you get "Permission denied" for config.txt?
- What command fixed the ownership?
- What's the difference between using sudo repeatedly vs fixing ownership once?
- When should you fix ownership instead of using sudo repeatedly?
- When should you NOT change ownership?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: The key is to FIX the problem once, not work around it repeatedly!
