                    "When is sudo Actually Needed?"
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 2!

Now you'll learn to identify when sudo is actually needed versus when it's not.
This is crucial for developing good Linux habits!

BACKGROUND:
-----------
Many beginners use sudo for everything when they get "Permission denied". But
sudo should only be used for ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS - tasks that require
system-level privileges.

The key question: "Is this really an administrative task, or is there a better
way to solve this?"

EXERCISE:
---------
You'll analyze different scenarios and determine when sudo is needed.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Stay in the data/system_files directory (or navigate there):
   cd ../../data/system_files

2. Read the readable.txt file (no sudo needed):
   cat readable.txt

3. Notice: This file doesn't require sudo. Why? Check its permissions:
   ls -l readable.txt

4. Now try to read the system_config.txt file:
   cat system_config.txt

5. You'll get "Permission denied" - check why:
   ls -l system_config.txt

6. Use sudo to read it:
   sudo cat system_config.txt

7. Now analyze the three scenarios:

   SCENARIO A: Reading your own file in your home directory
   - Would you need sudo? NO
   - Why? You own the file, you have permissions

   SCENARIO B: Installing a system package (like nginx)
   - Would you need sudo? YES
   - Why? Installing packages modifies system-wide configuration

   SCENARIO C: Creating a file in /tmp directory
   - Would you need sudo? NO
   - Why? /tmp is designed for temporary files, accessible to all users

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cat readable.txt (should work without sudo)
- ls -l readable.txt
- cat system_config.txt (will fail)
- ls -l system_config.txt
- sudo cat system_config.txt (should work)

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- What's the difference between readable.txt and system_config.txt?
- Who owns each file?
- What are the permission differences?
- When is sudo actually needed?
- When is sudo NOT needed?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
sudo is needed for:
- System administration tasks (installing packages, modifying system configs)
- Reading system-protected files (like /etc/shadow)
- Modifying system directories (like /etc, /usr, /var)
- Services that affect the entire system

sudo is NOT needed for:
- Working with your own files in your home directory
- Creating files in /tmp
- Running your own scripts (if they have proper permissions)
- Reading files you have permission to read

The key: Ask yourself "Is this a system-level operation or a user-level operation?"

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- What's the difference between readable.txt and system_config.txt?
- When is sudo actually needed? (Give 3 examples)
- When is sudo NOT needed? (Give 3 examples)
- What's the key question to ask before using sudo?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue3.txt in this same directory.

Hint: Think about whether the operation affects the entire system or just
your user account!
