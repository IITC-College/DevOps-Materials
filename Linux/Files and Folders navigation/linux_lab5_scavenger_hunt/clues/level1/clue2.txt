Great job finding the password hint!

Now let's practice file searching.

TASK:
-----
Find a file named "secret_code.txt" somewhere in the lab directory structure.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Go back to the main lab directory (linux_scavenger_hunt)
2. Use the 'find' command to locate the file
3. The file contains a 4-digit code - remember it!

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- Go to lab root: cd ../..
- Find the file: find . -name "secret_code.txt"
- Once found, read it: cat <path_to_file>

The code you find will be needed later!

Next clue: clue3.txt
