                            LEVEL 1 SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

EXERCISE 1 - Setup + Delete the Wrong File
------------------------------------------
Setup Commands:
1. cd ~
2. mkdir linux_lab
3. mkdir linux_lab/docs
4. mkdir linux_lab/scripts
5. mkdir linux_lab/logs

Exercise 1 Commands:
1. touch linux_lab/docs/notes.txt
2. ls linux_lab/docs/  (verify creation)
3. rm linux_lab/docs/notes.txt
4. ls linux_lab/docs/  (verify deletion)
5. touch linux_lab/docs/notes.txt  (recreate)

Answers:
1. Why was the file deleted immediately?
   The file was deleted immediately because rm (remove) command in Linux
   does not ask for confirmation by default. Unlike GUI file managers
   that show a "Are you sure?" dialog, rm executes immediately.

2. What warning did Linux NOT give you?
   Linux did NOT give a confirmation prompt or warning message asking
   "Are you sure you want to delete this file?" The deletion happened
   instantly without any interactive confirmation.

Key Learning: rm is immediate and silent by default. Always double-check
the file path before running rm. Use rm -i for interactive mode.

EXERCISE 2 - rmdir Practice
---------------------------
Commands:
1. touch linux_lab/docs/file1.txt
2. touch linux_lab/docs/file2.txt
3. touch linux_lab/scripts/script1.sh
4. touch linux_lab/logs/log1.txt
5. rm linux_lab/docs/file1.txt
6. rmdir linux_lab/docs  (will fail - directory not empty)
7. rm linux_lab/docs/file2.txt
8. rm linux_lab/docs/notes.txt
9. rmdir linux_lab/docs  (will succeed - directory is now empty)

Answers:
- Error when trying to rmdir non-empty directory:
  "rmdir: failed to remove 'linux_lab/docs': Directory not empty"

- What this teaches about rmdir:
  rmdir only works on EMPTY directories. If a directory contains any files
  or subdirectories, rmdir will fail. You must delete all contents first,
  or use rm -r (recursive delete) instead.

Key Learning: rmdir is safe because it only removes empty directories.
This prevents accidental deletion of directories with content.

EXERCISE 3 - cp Command
-----------------------
Commands:
1. mkdir linux_lab/docs
2. touch linux_lab/scripts/run.sh
3. cp linux_lab/scripts/run.sh linux_lab/docs/
4. echo "#!/bin/bash" > linux_lab/scripts/config.sh
5. echo "echo Hello" >> linux_lab/scripts/config.sh
6. cp linux_lab/scripts/config.sh linux_lab/logs/
7. cat linux_lab/scripts/config.sh
8. cat linux_lab/logs/config.sh
9. echo "echo World" >> linux_lab/scripts/config.sh
10. cat linux_lab/scripts/config.sh
11. cat linux_lab/logs/config.sh

Answers:
- Difference between cp and rm:
  cp creates a COPY of the file, leaving the original intact.
  rm DELETES the file permanently.

- After modifying original, did copy change?
  No, the copy did NOT change. After copying, the original and copy are
  independent. Changes to one do not affect the other.

Key Learning: cp creates independent copies. The original and copy are
separate files after copying.

================================================================================
                            LEVEL 2 SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

EXERCISE 1 - Move to Wrong Location, Then Fix
----------------------------------------------
Commands:
1. cd ~
2. touch linux_lab/scripts/run.sh
3. ls linux_lab/scripts/  (verify)
4. mv linux_lab/scripts/run.sh linux_lab/docs/  (move to wrong place)
5. ls linux_lab/scripts/  (file gone)
6. ls linux_lab/docs/  (file here)
7. mv linux_lab/docs/run.sh linux_lab/scripts/  (fix mistake)
8. ls linux_lab/scripts/  (file back)
9. ls linux_lab/docs/  (file gone)

Answers:
1. Where was the file moved incorrectly?
   The file was moved to the docs/ directory instead of staying in scripts/.

2. How did you fix it?
   Fixed by moving the file back: mv linux_lab/docs/run.sh linux_lab/scripts/

Key Learning: mv moves the file (doesn't keep a copy). Unlike cp, the
original location no longer has the file after mv.

EXERCISE 2 - Renaming Files with mv
------------------------------------
Commands:
1. touch linux_lab/scripts/my_very_long_script_name.sh
2. ls linux_lab/scripts/
3. mv linux_lab/scripts/my_very_long_script_name.sh linux_lab/scripts/short.sh
4. ls linux_lab/scripts/
5. touch linux_lab/docs/old_name.txt
6. mv linux_lab/docs/old_name.txt linux_lab/docs/new_name.txt
7. ls linux_lab/docs/

Answers:
- Two uses of mv:
  1. Move files between directories
  2. Rename files (when source and destination are in same directory)

- How is mv different from cp when renaming?
  mv renames the file (original is removed, new name appears).
  cp would create a copy with new name (both old and new would exist).

Key Learning: mv serves dual purpose - moving and renaming. It's the same
command, Linux figures out what you want based on the paths.

EXERCISE 3 - Combining cp and mv
---------------------------------
Commands:
1. echo "Version 1.0" > linux_lab/scripts/app.sh
2. cp linux_lab/scripts/app.sh linux_lab/docs/app_backup.sh
3. echo "Version 2.0" > linux_lab/scripts/app.sh
4. cat linux_lab/scripts/app.sh
5. cat linux_lab/docs/app_backup.sh
6. mv linux_lab/docs/app_backup.sh linux_lab/logs/app_backup.sh
7. ls linux_lab/docs/
8. ls linux_lab/logs/
9. mv linux_lab/logs/app_backup.sh linux_lab/logs/app_v1.sh
10. ls linux_lab/logs/

Answers:
- When to use cp instead of mv:
  Use cp when you want to keep the original file and create a copy.
  Example: Creating backups, duplicating files.

- When to use mv instead of cp:
  Use mv when you want to relocate a file or rename it, and don't need
  the original location. Example: Organizing files, renaming.

Key Learning: cp = keep original, mv = relocate/rename. Choose based on
whether you need the original to remain.

                            LEVEL 3 SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

EXERCISE 1 - mkdir vs mkdir -p
-------------------------------
Commands:
1. cd ~
2. mkdir linux_lab/projects/app1  (will fail)
3. Error: "mkdir: cannot create directory 'linux_lab/projects/app1': 
          No such file or directory"
4. ls linux_lab/  (projects doesn't exist)
5. mkdir linux_lab/projects
6. mkdir linux_lab/projects/app1  (will succeed)
7. ls linux_lab/projects/
8. rmdir linux_lab/projects/app1
9. rmdir linux_lab/projects
10. mkdir -p linux_lab/projects/app1  (succeeds in one command)
11. ls -R linux_lab/projects/

Answers:
1. Why did the first command (mkdir) fail?
   The first command failed because the parent directory 'projects' did
   not exist. mkdir can only create one directory at a time, and requires
   all parent directories to already exist.

2. Why did the second command (mkdir -p) succeed?
   The second command succeeded because the -p flag tells mkdir to create
   all parent directories automatically. So it created both 'projects' and
   'app1' in a single command.

Key Learning: mkdir -p is essential for creating nested directory structures.
The -p flag stands for "parents" and creates parent directories as needed.

EXERCISE 2 - Complex Directory Structures
------------------------------------------
Commands:
1. mkdir -p linux_lab/projects/app1/src
2. mkdir -p linux_lab/projects/app1/docs
3. mkdir -p linux_lab/projects/app2/tests
4. ls -R linux_lab/projects/
5. mkdir -p linux_lab/deep/nested/directory/structure/here
6. ls -R linux_lab/deep/
7. touch linux_lab/projects/app1/src/main.sh
8. touch linux_lab/projects/app1/docs/README.txt
9. touch linux_lab/deep/nested/directory/structure/here/file.txt
10. find linux_lab -type f

Answers:
- How many directory levels in "deep" structure?
  5 levels: deep -> nested -> directory -> structure -> here

- Why is mkdir -p so useful?
  mkdir -p is useful because it allows creating complex nested directory
  structures in a single command, without needing to create each level
  separately. It's safer and more convenient than regular mkdir.

Key Learning: mkdir -p is the standard way to create directory structures.
Always use -p unless you're absolutely sure all parent directories exist.

EXERCISE 3 - Final Challenge
-----------------------------
Commands (comprehensive example):
1. rm -r linux_lab  (optional - start fresh)
2. mkdir -p linux_lab/project/src
3. mkdir -p linux_lab/project/docs
4. mkdir -p linux_lab/project/tests
5. mkdir -p linux_lab/backups
6. touch linux_lab/project/src/main.sh
7. touch linux_lab/project/src/utils.sh
8. touch linux_lab/project/docs/README.txt
9. cp linux_lab/project/src/main.sh linux_lab/backups/
10. cp linux_lab/project/src/utils.sh linux_lab/backups/
11. mv linux_lab/project/docs/README.txt linux_lab/project/src/  (wrong place)
12. mv linux_lab/project/src/README.txt linux_lab/project/docs/  (fix)
13. mv linux_lab/project/src/utils.sh linux_lab/project/src/utilities.sh
14. rm linux_lab/backups/utils.sh
15. find linux_lab -type f
16. ls -R linux_lab/

Final Answers:
1. Main difference between mkdir and mkdir -p:
   mkdir creates a single directory and requires parent to exist.
   mkdir -p creates nested directories and creates parents automatically.

2. Difference between cp and mv:
   cp creates a copy (original remains).
   mv moves/renames the file (original is removed from source).

3. Warning Linux does NOT give with rm:
   Linux does NOT ask "Are you sure?" or give any confirmation prompt.
   The file is deleted immediately and silently.

4. What you learned:
   (Student's personal reflection - various valid answers about file
   management, command differences, error handling, etc.)
