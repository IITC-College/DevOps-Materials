================================================================================

FINAL CHALLENGE!

You've mastered file and directory management. Now complete this final mission.

EXERCISE:
---------
Complete a comprehensive file management task using everything you've learned.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
Your mission: Create, organize, and manage a complete project structure.

1. Start fresh - remove your old linux_lab (if you want):
   Run: rm -r linux_lab
   (This removes everything - be careful!)

2. Create a new project structure:
   Run: mkdir -p linux_lab/project/src
   Run: mkdir -p linux_lab/project/docs
   Run: mkdir -p linux_lab/project/tests
   Run: mkdir -p linux_lab/backups

3. Create some files:
   Run: touch linux_lab/project/src/main.sh
   Run: touch linux_lab/project/src/utils.sh
   Run: touch linux_lab/project/docs/README.txt

4. Copy files to backup:
   Run: cp linux_lab/project/src/main.sh linux_lab/backups/
   Run: cp linux_lab/project/src/utils.sh linux_lab/backups/

5. Move a file to the wrong place (on purpose):
   Run: mv linux_lab/project/docs/README.txt linux_lab/project/src/

6. Fix the mistake:
   Run: mv linux_lab/project/src/README.txt linux_lab/project/docs/

7. Rename a file:
   Run: mv linux_lab/project/src/utils.sh linux_lab/project/src/utilities.sh

8. Delete a backup file:
   Run: rm linux_lab/backups/utils.sh

9. Verify your final structure:
   Run: find linux_lab -type f
   Run: tree linux_lab/  (if tree is installed)
   OR: ls -R linux_lab/

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- All the commands you've learned!
- mkdir, mkdir -p, touch, cp, mv, rm, rmdir
- find, ls -R

FINAL QUESTIONS:
----------------
Answer these in my_answers.txt:

1. What is the main difference between mkdir and mkdir -p?
2. What is the difference between cp and mv?
3. What warning does Linux NOT give you when using rm?
4. What did you learn about file management in Linux?

CONGRATULATIONS!
================

You've completed the Linux File Management Lab!

You now know:
- How to create directories (mkdir, mkdir -p)
- How to create files (touch)
- How to copy files (cp)
- How to move and rename files (mv)
- How to delete files and directories (rm, rmdir)
- How to fix mistakes
- How to read error messages

Great job! These commands are the foundation of file management in Linux.
Keep practicing - they'll become second nature!
