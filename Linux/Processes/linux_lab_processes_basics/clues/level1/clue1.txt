            "What is a Process?" - Your First Process List
================================================================================

* SETUP: Run first (from this folder):  ../../scripts/setup_1_1.sh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A process is a program running in memory. Linux gives each process a unique
number (PID). Your job: list processes and see how many are running. You don't
need to understand every column – just know where to look (PID, USER, COMMAND).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. List processes in a simple form. Then list them again with more detail
   (user, PID, command). Hint: ps, then ps aux.

2. Look at the output. How many processes (roughly) do you see? Each line
   is one process.

3. Write in my_answers.txt (lab root: cd ../../..): one sentence – how many
   processes did you see?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP (run when done with this clue):  ../../scripts/cleanup_1_1.sh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NEXT STEP:  cat clue2.txt
