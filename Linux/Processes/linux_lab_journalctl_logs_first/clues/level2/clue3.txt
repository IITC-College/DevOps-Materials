                    LEVEL 2 - CLUE 3
            "Describe Like a DevOps" - Full Problem Description
================================================================================

* SETUP: Run first (from this folder):  ../../scripts/setup_2_3.sh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A good DevOps can describe a problem clearly: what failed, when, why, and what
the impact is. Not just copy an error line. Your job: find all relevant log
entries for the lab scenario, trace the failure, then write a short professional
problem description.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Use journalctl --user to view logs for the lab service(s) the setup started.
   Find every relevant line: errors, warnings, and the sequence of events.

2. Trace the failure: what happened first, what happened next, what was the
   root cause? (Use -u, -xe, --since, -p as needed.)

3. Write in my_answers.txt a professional problem description (3–4 sentences).
   Include:
   - Which service failed?
   - When did it fail?
   - What was the root cause?
   - What was the impact?
   Bad example: "Error: file not found"
   Good example: "The lab-app service failed to start at 14:32 because it could
   not access /var/lab/config.txt (permission denied). This prevents the
   application from loading its configuration, making the service unavailable."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP (run when done with this clue):  ../../scripts/cleanup_2_3.sh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NEXT STEP:  You have completed the lab. Congratulations!
