            "Service Not Working"
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If someone says "the service doesn't work," the first step is **systemctl
status** – read the output. Is it active? failed? What does the message
say? That tells you why. Distinguish "service running" (unit active) vs
"process running" (Main PID present). Don't blindly restart – read status
first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Conceptual: If you're told "the service doesn't work," what do you do
   first? (Run systemctl status – or systemctl --user status for a user
   service – and read the output: active? failed? error message?)

2. Write in my_answers.txt: "When a service 'doesn't work,' I run status
   first to see why (active, failed, error message). Service running =
   unit active; process running = Main PID present."
