            "If the Process Dies, the Service Can Restart It"
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's the key idea: if the *process* belonging to a service crashes or is
killed, systemd can restart it. So the *service* stays "running" even though
the original process is gone. Process = what is running. Service = what should
be running, and systemd makes sure it stays that way.

(We don't kill a real service in this lab – just understand the concept.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Think about it: if you killed the process of a service (e.g. the Main PID
   you saw in systemctl status), systemd could start a new process for that
   same service. So the service is "still running" – with a new PID.

2. Write in my_answers.txt: "If the process dies, systemd can restart it so
   the service stays running. Process = what runs; service = what should
   run (managed by systemd)."
