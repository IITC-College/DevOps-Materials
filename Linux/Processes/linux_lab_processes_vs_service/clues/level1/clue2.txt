            "Processes Can Disappear"
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you kill a process (or it crashes), it's gone. Nothing automatically
brings it back. That raises a question: what if we want something to *keep*
running – even after it dies or someone stops it? That idea leads to
"services."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Think about it: you've seen that kill stops a process. After that, the
   process is no longer in the list (ps). No one restarts it for you.

2. Write in my_answers.txt: In one sentence, what happens when a process
   is killed or crashes? (It's gone; nothing brings it back unless we do
   something special.)
