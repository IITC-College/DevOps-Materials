                    HIDDEN FILE SUCCESS
================================================================================

Congratulations! You successfully found and accessed the hidden file!

This file starts with a dot (.), making it a hidden file in Linux. You used
the 4-step methodology:

1. OBSERVED that the file wasn't found with regular ls
2. INSPECTED with ls -la to see all files including hidden ones
3. DIAGNOSED that the file was hidden (starts with .)
4. RESOLVED by accessing it with the full name including the dot

Key learning: Files starting with . are hidden and require ls -la to see them.

Well done!
