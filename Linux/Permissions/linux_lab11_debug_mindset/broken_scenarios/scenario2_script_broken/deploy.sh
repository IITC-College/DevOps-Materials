Congratulations! You successfully debugged the execute permission problem!

This script was missing execute permission. You used the 4-step methodology:

1. OBSERVED the 'Permission denied' error when trying to run the script
2. INSPECTED the file permissions with ls -l
3. DIAGNOSED that the file was missing execute (x) permission
4. RESOLVED by adding execute permission with chmod +x

Well done! Remember: scripts need execute permission to run.
