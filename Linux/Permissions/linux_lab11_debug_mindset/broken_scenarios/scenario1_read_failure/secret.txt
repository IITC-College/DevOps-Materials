Congratulations! You successfully debugged the permission problem!

This file contains important information that was protected. You used the
4-step methodology to solve the problem:

1. OBSERVED the "Permission denied" error
2. INSPECTED the file permissions with ls -l
3. DIAGNOSED that the file had restrictive permissions (000 or similar)
4. RESOLVED by fixing the permissions with chmod

Well done! This is exactly how you should approach any Linux problem.
