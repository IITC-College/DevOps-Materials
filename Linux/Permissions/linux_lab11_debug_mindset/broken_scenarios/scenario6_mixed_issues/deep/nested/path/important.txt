                    NESTED DIRECTORY SUCCESS
================================================================================

Congratulations! You successfully navigated through nested directories!

This file is deep in a directory structure. To access it, you needed execute
permission on ALL parent directories:
- deep/
- deep/nested/
- deep/nested/path/

You used the 4-step methodology:
1. OBSERVED the error when trying to access the file
2. INSPECTED each directory's permissions with ls -ld
3. DIAGNOSED that parent directories were missing execute permission
4. RESOLVED by fixing execute permissions on all parent directories

Key learning: To access a file in a nested path, you need execute (x)
permission on ALL parent directories to traverse the path.

Well done!
