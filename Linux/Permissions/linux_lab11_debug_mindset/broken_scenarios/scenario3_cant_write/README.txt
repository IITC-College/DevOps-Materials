                    DIRECTORY WRITE PERMISSIONS
================================================================================

This directory was set up to demonstrate directory write permissions.

To create a file in a directory, you need WRITE permission on the DIRECTORY
itself, not on the file (which doesn't exist yet).

You should have:
1. OBSERVED the error when trying to create a file
2. INSPECTED the directory permissions with ls -ld
3. DIAGNOSED that the directory was missing write permission
4. RESOLVED by fixing directory permissions

Well done!
