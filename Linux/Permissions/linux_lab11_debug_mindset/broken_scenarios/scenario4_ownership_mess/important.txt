                    OWNERSHIP MATTERS
================================================================================

Congratulations! You successfully debugged the ownership problem!

This file was owned by a different user (likely root). You used the
4-step methodology:

1. OBSERVED the 'Permission denied' error despite seeing read permissions
2. INSPECTED the file ownership with ls -l and checked your user with whoami
3. DIAGNOSED that the file was owned by a different user with no group/other access
4. RESOLVED by fixing ownership with sudo chown (or requesting access)

Key learning: Ownership matters! Even if permissions look OK, if you're
not the owner and there's no group/other permission, you can't access it.

Well done!
