# Release v4.1 – Linux Lab 11: Debug Mindset

## Summary

Lab 11: full refactor with a single setup script and clear step-by-step clues.

## What’s included

- **Single setup**: One `setup_lab.sh` run before the lab
- **Structured clues**: Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 with step-by-step instructions
- **4-step flow**: OBSERVE → INSPECT → DIAGNOSE → RESOLVE on every exercise
- **Broken scenarios**: Read failure, script execute, directory write, ownership, path, and mixed issues

## For instructors

Before students start:

```bash
sudo ./setup_lab.sh
```

## For students

Start with `start_here.txt`, then work through `clues/level1`, `clues/level2`, and `clues/level3` in order.
