                    THE 4-STEP DEBUG METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

STOP! Before you randomly try commands, follow this process:

================================================================================
STEP 1: OBSERVE
================================================================================

What exactly is happening?
- What is the exact error message?
- What command were you trying to run?
- What symptoms do you see?
- What were you expecting to happen?

DON'T SKIP THIS STEP! Read the error message carefully. It contains clues.

Example observations:
- "Permission denied"
- "No such file or directory"
- "Command not found"
- Script runs but produces wrong output

================================================================================
STEP 2: INSPECT
================================================================================

Check the current state of the system. Gather evidence before making changes.

Essential inspection commands:
- pwd          → Where am I right now?
- ls -l        → What are the file permissions and ownership?
- ls -la       → What files exist (including hidden ones)?
- ls -ld       → What are the directory permissions?
- whoami       → What user am I running as?
- id           → What are my user ID and groups?
- file <name>  → What type of file is this?

DON'T GUESS! Use these commands to gather real evidence.

Example inspection:
- Error: "Permission denied" when reading file
- Inspection: ls -l shows -rw------- owned by root
- Evidence: File has restrictive permissions, owned by different user

================================================================================
STEP 3: DIAGNOSE
================================================================================

Based on the evidence from INSPECT, identify the root cause.

Ask yourself:
- Is it a permissions problem? (missing r, w, or x)
- Is it an ownership problem? (file owned by wrong user)
- Is it a path problem? (wrong directory, file doesn't exist)
- Is it a hidden file problem? (file exists but starts with .)
- Is it something else?

DON'T GUESS! Base your diagnosis on the evidence you gathered.

Example diagnosis:
- Evidence: File is -rw------- owned by root, you are user "student"
- Diagnosis: Root cause is ownership mismatch - file belongs to root,
  not to you, and has no group/other permissions

================================================================================
STEP 4: RESOLVE
================================================================================

Apply the correct fix based on your diagnosis. Fix the root cause, not
just the symptom.

Common fixes:
- chmod <permissions> <file>     → Fix file permissions
- chmod <permissions> <directory> → Fix directory permissions
- sudo chown <user>:<group> <file> → Fix ownership (when appropriate)
- cd <correct_path>              → Navigate to correct location
- Use correct command with proper path

DON'T USE WORKAROUNDS! Fix the actual problem.

Example resolution:
- Diagnosis: Ownership mismatch
- Resolution: sudo chown $USER:$USER file.txt (fix ownership once)
- NOT: sudo cat file.txt every time (workaround)

After fixing, INSPECT again to verify the fix worked!

================================================================================
REMEMBER: NO TRIAL-AND-ERROR!
================================================================================

The goal is NOT to try random commands until something works.

The goal IS to:
1. OBSERVE what's wrong
2. INSPECT to gather evidence
3. DIAGNOSE the root cause
4. RESOLVE with the correct fix

Follow these steps for EVERY problem in this lab. This methodology will
help you solve ANY Linux problem systematically, not just permissions!
