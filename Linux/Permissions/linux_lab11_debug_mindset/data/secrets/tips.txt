                        DEBUGGING TIPS
================================================================================

If you're stuck, remember:

1. READ THE ERROR MESSAGE - It tells you what's wrong!

2. USE ls -l - It shows you permissions and ownership

3. CHECK WHERE YOU ARE - Use pwd to see your current location

4. LOOK FOR HIDDEN FILES - Use ls -la to see files starting with .

5. THINK ABOUT THE 4 STEPS:
   - What did you OBSERVE? (error message)
   - What did you INSPECT? (permissions, ownership, path)
   - What did you DIAGNOSE? (root cause)
   - How did you RESOLVE? (correct fix)

6. DON'T GUESS - Use commands to gather evidence first

7. FIX THE ROOT CAUSE - Not just the symptom

8. VERIFY YOUR FIX - Check with ls -l after fixing
