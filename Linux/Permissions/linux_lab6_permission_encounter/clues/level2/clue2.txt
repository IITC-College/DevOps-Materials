                    "Why Can't I Read This?" - Connecting Permissions to Access
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 2!

Now let's connect what you see in `ls -l` to what actually happens when you
try to access a file. This is the key skill: PREDICTING access based on
permissions.

EXERCISE:
---------
Try to read a file you don't have permission for, and understand WHY access
was denied by looking at the permissions first.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the restricted directory:
   cd ../restricted

2. FIRST, check the permissions (READ BEFORE ACTING):
   ls -l

3. Look at the output. Notice:
   - Who is the owner of each file?
   - What are the permissions for "others" (last 3 characters)?
   - Are you the owner? (Check with: id)

4. Now try to read a file:
   cat secret_file.txt
   (or try: cat admin_config.txt)

5. You should get "Permission denied"

6. Explain WHY: Look at the permissions you saw in step 2

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd ../restricted
- ls -l
- id (to see your user ID)
- cat secret_file.txt

UNDERSTANDING ACCESS:
---------------------
Linux checks permissions in this order:
1. Are you the OWNER? → Use owner permissions
2. Are you in the GROUP? → Use group permissions
3. Otherwise → Use others permissions

If the relevant permission set doesn't have 'r' (read), you get
"Permission denied".

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After trying to read the file, write in my_answers.txt:
- What error message did you get?
- What are the permissions for "others" on secret_file.txt?
- Why can't you read it? (Explain: you're not the owner, not in the group,
  and others don't have read permission)
- What would need to change for you to read it? (Just explain - don't change
  anything!)
