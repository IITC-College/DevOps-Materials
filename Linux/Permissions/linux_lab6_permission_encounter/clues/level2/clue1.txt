                    "Decoding Permission Strings" - Understanding rwx
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 2!

You've seen permission strings like `-rw-r--r--`. Now let's learn to decode
what they mean. This is the foundation of understanding Linux permissions.

EXERCISE:
---------
Learn to read and understand permission strings (rwx patterns).

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the projects directory:
   cd ../../projects

2. List files with detailed information:
   ls -l

3. Look at the permission strings (first column). Each has 10 characters:
   - Position 1: File type (- for regular file, d for directory)
   - Positions 2-4: Owner permissions (r = read, w = write, x = execute)
   - Positions 5-7: Group permissions
   - Positions 8-10: Others permissions

4. For each file, identify:
   - Owner permissions (positions 2-4)
   - Group permissions (positions 5-7)
   - Others permissions (positions 8-10)

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd ../../projects
- ls -l

UNDERSTANDING PERMISSION CHARACTERS:
-------------------------------------
- r = read (can view file contents)
- w = write (can modify file)
- x = execute (can run file as program)
- - = no permission (cannot do that action)

EXAMPLES:
---------
-rw-r--r-- means:
  Owner:   rw-  (read + write, no execute)
  Group:   r--  (read only)
  Others:  r--  (read only)

-rwx------ means:
  Owner:   rwx  (read + write + execute)
  Group:   ---  (no permissions)
  Others:  ---  (no permissions)

-r-------- means:
  Owner:   r--  (read only)
  Group:   ---  (no permissions)
  Others:  ---  (no permissions)

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After examining the files, write in my_answers.txt:
- What are the owner permissions for team_script.sh?
- What are the group permissions for config.json?
- What are the others permissions for logs.txt?
- What does "rwx" mean? (explain in your own words)
