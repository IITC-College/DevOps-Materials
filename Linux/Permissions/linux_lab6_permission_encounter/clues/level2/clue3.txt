                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 3
                    "Practice Reading Before Acting" - Building the Habit
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 3!

This exercise reinforces the most important habit: ALWAYS check permissions
with `ls -l` BEFORE trying to access a file. This prevents frustration and
helps you understand the system.

EXERCISE:
---------
Practice the "read before acting" pattern across multiple directories.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
For each directory below, follow this pattern:
1. Navigate to the directory
2. Run `ls -l` FIRST
3. PREDICT which files you can read (based on permissions)
4. TRY to read one file
5. VERIFY your prediction

Directories to check:
- projects/personal_project/
- projects/team_project/
- restricted/

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd projects/personal_project
- ls -l
- cat <filename> (try reading a file)
- cd ../team_project
- ls -l
- cat <filename>
- cd ../../restricted
- ls -l
- cat <filename>

PREDICTION PROCESS:
-------------------
1. Look at `ls -l` output
2. Check: Are you the owner? (compare with `id` output)
3. Check: Are you in the group? (compare with `groups` output)
4. Check: What permissions apply to you?
5. If 'r' is present in your permission set → You can read
6. If 'r' is NOT present → You'll get Permission denied

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After checking all three directories, write in my_answers.txt:
- In personal_project/: Which files can you read? Why?
- In team_project/: Which files can you read? Why?
- In restricted/: Can you read any files? Why or why not?
- What did you learn about checking permissions first?

Congratulations! You've completed Level 2!

Now proceed to Level 3: cd ../../clues/level3
