                            LEVEL 3 - EXERCISE 3
                    "Final Reflection" - Synthesizing Your Learning
================================================================================

Welcome to the Final Exercise!

This is your chance to demonstrate your understanding by finding and
explaining different permission patterns. You've learned to read permissions
- now show what you understand!

EXERCISE:
---------
Find three different files with different permission patterns and explain
why each has its specific permissions.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Search through the lab directories for files with interesting permissions

2. Find three files with DIFFERENT permission patterns, for example:
   - One file with public read access (rw-r--r--)
   - One file with private access (rw-------)
   - One file with executable permissions (rwxr-xr-x)

3. For each file:
   a. Show the `ls -l` output
   b. Explain what the permissions mean
   c. Explain WHY those permissions make sense for that file
   d. Test if you can read it (and explain why/why not)

4. Write your findings in my_answers.txt

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l (in various directories)
- cat <file> (to test reading)
- find . -type f -exec ls -l {} \; (optional: find all files)

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
---------------------
Think about:
- What have you learned about Linux permissions?
- Why is "Permission denied" actually a good thing?
- What's the most important habit you've developed?
- How will you use `ls -l` in the future?

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
In my_answers.txt, write:

1. File 1: [filename]
   - Permissions: [show ls -l output]
   - What it means: [explain rwx pattern]
   - Why it makes sense: [explain why these permissions are appropriate]
   - Can you read it? [yes/no and why]

2. File 2: [filename]
   - Permissions: [show ls -l output]
   - What it means: [explain rwx pattern]
   - Why it makes sense: [explain why these permissions are appropriate]
   - Can you read it? [yes/no and why]

3. File 3: [filename]
   - Permissions: [show ls -l output]
   - What it means: [explain rwx pattern]
   - Why it makes sense: [explain why these permissions are appropriate]
   - Can you read it? [yes/no and why]

4. Reflection: Write 2-3 sentences about what you learned in this lab.

================================================================================
                            CONGRATULATIONS!
================================================================================

You've completed the Permission Encounter Lab!

You've learned:
✓ That "Permission denied" is normal and expected
✓ How to read `ls -l` output
✓ How to identify file owners and groups
✓ How to decode permission strings (rwx)
✓ How to predict file access based on permissions
✓ Why system files have different permission levels

Most importantly, you've developed the habit of READING permissions BEFORE
trying to access files. This is a crucial skill for working with Linux!

In the next labs, you'll learn how to CHANGE permissions. But remember:
always READ before you CHANGE!

Well done! 🎉
