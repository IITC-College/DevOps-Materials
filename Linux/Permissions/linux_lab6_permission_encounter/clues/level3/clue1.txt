                            LEVEL 3 - EXERCISE 1
                    "The Detective Challenge" - Finding Accessible Files
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 3!

You're now a permission detective! Your mission: Find all files you CAN read
by using `ls -l` to predict access, then verify your predictions.

EXERCISE:
---------
Scan the entire lab directory structure and identify which files you can
actually read, using only `ls -l` for prediction.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Start from the lab root directory:
   cd ../../..

2. Scan each directory with `ls -l`:
   - data/files/
   - data/logs/
   - data/secrets/
   - projects/personal_project/
   - projects/team_project/
   - projects/shared_project/
   - restricted/

3. For each directory:
   a. Run `ls -l` to see permissions
   b. PREDICT which files you can read (based on owner/group/permissions)
   c. TRY to read one file to verify
   d. RECORD the result

4. Create a list of:
   - Files you CAN read (and why)
   - Files you CANNOT read (and why)

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l <directory>
- cat <file> (to test reading)
- id (to check your user ID)
- groups (to check your groups)

DETECTIVE TIPS:
---------------
Remember the access check order:
1. Are you the owner? → Check owner permissions
2. Are you in the group? → Check group permissions
3. Otherwise → Check others permissions

If 'r' is in the relevant permission set → You can read!

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After scanning all directories, write in my_answers.txt:
- List at least 3 files you CAN read and explain why for each
- List at least 2 files you CANNOT read and explain why for each
- What pattern do you notice about accessible vs. inaccessible files?
