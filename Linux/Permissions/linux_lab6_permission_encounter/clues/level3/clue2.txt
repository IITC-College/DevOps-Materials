                            LEVEL 3 - EXERCISE 2
                    "System Files Exploration" - Real-World Permissions
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 2!

Now let's explore REAL system files and understand why they have different
permissions. This connects what you've learned to the actual Linux system.

EXERCISE:
---------
Explore system files and understand why each has its specific permissions.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Check permissions on several system files:
   ls -l /etc/passwd
   ls -l /etc/shadow
   ls -l /etc/hostname
   ls -l /etc/group

2. Try to read each file:
   cat /etc/passwd
   cat /etc/shadow
   cat /etc/hostname
   cat /etc/group

3. Observe which ones you can read and which give "Permission denied"

4. Think about WHY each file has its specific permissions

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l /etc/passwd
- ls -l /etc/shadow
- ls -l /etc/hostname
- ls -l /etc/group
- cat /etc/passwd (try reading)
- cat /etc/shadow (try reading - will fail)
- cat /etc/hostname (try reading)
- cat /etc/group (try reading)

UNDERSTANDING SYSTEM FILES:
---------------------------
- /etc/passwd: Contains user account information (readable by all)
- /etc/shadow: Contains encrypted passwords (protected, readable only by root)
- /etc/hostname: Contains the system hostname (usually readable by all)
- /etc/group: Contains group information (readable by all)

The permissions reflect the security needs:
- Public information (like usernames) → readable by all
- Sensitive information (like passwords) → protected

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After exploring the system files, write in my_answers.txt:
- What are the permissions on /etc/passwd? Can you read it? Why?
- What are the permissions on /etc/shadow? Can you read it? Why not?
- Why do you think /etc/passwd is readable by everyone but /etc/shadow is not?
- What security principle does this demonstrate?
