                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 1
                    "The Locked File" - Your First Permission Denied
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 1!

Your first exercise: Encountering "Permission denied" for the first time.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
In Linux, many files are protected for security reasons. When you try to
access a protected file, you'll see "Permission denied". This is NOT a bug
or error - it's the system working correctly to protect sensitive information.

EXERCISE:
---------
Try to read a protected system file and see what happens.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Try to read a system file that contains sensitive information:
   
   cat /etc/shadow

2. Look at the message that appears
3. Read it carefully - what is Linux telling you?

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cat /etc/shadow

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- What error message appears?
- What does it say?
- Does it make sense that this file is protected?

IMPORTANT:
----------
This "Permission denied" message is EXPECTED and NORMAL. The /etc/shadow
file contains encrypted passwords and is protected by design. This is a
security feature, not a problem to fix!

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After running the command, write in one sentence:
- What error message did you see?
- Why do you think this file is protected?

You can write your answer in a file called my_answers.txt in the main lab
directory (go back with: cd ../../..)

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: Don't be afraid of "Permission denied" - it's teaching you about
Linux security!
