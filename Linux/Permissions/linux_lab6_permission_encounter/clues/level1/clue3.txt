                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 3
                    "Who Owns What?" - Identifying Owners and Groups
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 3!

Now let's practice identifying file owners and groups. This is important
because ownership affects who can access files.

EXERCISE:
---------
Practice reading `ls -l` output to identify file owners and groups.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Make sure you're in the data/files directory:
   cd ../../data/files
   (or use: pwd to check your location)

2. List files with detailed information:
   ls -l

3. For each file, identify:
   - The owner (third column)
   - The group (fourth column)

4. Notice which files belong to the same owner
5. Notice which files belong to the same group

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l
- pwd (to check your location)

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- Which files have the same owner?
- Which files have the same group?
- How many different owners are there?
- How many different groups are there?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
In Linux, every file has:
- An OWNER (the user who created it or was assigned ownership)
- A GROUP (a collection of users who share certain permissions)
- PERMISSIONS (what the owner, group, and others can do)

The owner and group determine who can access the file, along with the
permissions.

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After examining the files, write in my_answers.txt:
- List all the different owners you found
- List all the different groups you found
- Which files belong to the same owner? (list at least one example)
- Which files belong to the same group? (list at least one example)

Congratulations! You've completed Level 1!

Now proceed to Level 2: cd ../../clues/level2
Read clue1.txt to continue your permission journey.
