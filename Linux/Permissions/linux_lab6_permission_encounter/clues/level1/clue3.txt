                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 3
                    "Who Owns What?" - Comparing Owners and Groups
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 3!

You already know where owner and group appear in ls -l (Exercise 2). Now
use that same listing to COMPARE files: which share an owner? which share
a group? Why does that matter for who can read or change a file?

EXERCISE:
---------
From the ls -l output you saw in data/files, list all the different owners
and groups, and give one example of "files that share an owner" and one
example of "files that share a group." Then connect this to access: the
owner and group (with permissions) determine who can access the file.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Use your ls -l output from data/files (or run again if needed:
   cd ../../data/files && ls -l).

2. Scan the third column (owner) and fourth column (group). Write down:
   - Every distinct owner name you see (e.g. alice, bob, root)
   - Every distinct group name you see (e.g. developers, team_dev, ...)

3. Find at least one pair (or set) of files that have the SAME owner.
   Example: "public_data.txt and report.sh both have owner alice."

4. Find at least one pair (or set) of files that have the SAME group.
   Example: "public_data.txt and report.sh both have group developers."

5. Remember: owner and group (plus the permission string) decide who can
   read, write, or execute the file. Different owners/groups = different
   people can access different files.

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- How many different owners? How many different groups?
- Which files share an owner? Which share a group?
- Why it matters: only the owner (or users in the file's group, or "others"
  if permissions allow) can access the file accordingly.

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
In my_answers.txt (main lab directory), write:
- List all the owner(s) you see for files in data/files (no duplicates).
- List all the group(s) you see (no duplicates).
- One example: "These files have the same owner: ..."
- One example: "These files have the same group: ..."

Congratulations! You've completed Level 1!

Now proceed to Level 2: cd ../../clues/level2
Read clue1.txt to continue your permission journey.
