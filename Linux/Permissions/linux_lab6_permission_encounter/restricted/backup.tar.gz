This is a backup archive file that should be protected.

File: backup.tar.gz
Owner: root
Group: root
Permissions: rw------- (owner: read+write, group: none, others: none)

Note: This is a text file representing a backup archive. In a real system,
this would be a binary tar.gz file. For this lab, it's a text file to
demonstrate permission concepts.

Regular users should not be able to access backup files as they may
contain sensitive system data.
