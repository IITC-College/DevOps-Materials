Personal Notes - Confidential

These are private notes that should only be accessible by bob (the owner).
Even though bob is in the "developers" group, this file is set to be
private to demonstrate that ownership takes precedence.

Personal reminders:
- Review code changes
- Update documentation
- Schedule team meeting

This file demonstrates that file ownership and permissions are independent
of group membership. A file can be private even if the owner is in a group.
