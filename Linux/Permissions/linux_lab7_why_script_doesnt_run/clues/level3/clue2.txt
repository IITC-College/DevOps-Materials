                    "When x is NOT Needed" - Understanding File Types
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 2!

Not all files need execute permission. Let's understand which files need
'x' and which don't.

EXERCISE:
---------
Compare different file types and understand when execute permission is needed.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the data/configs directory:
   cd ../../data/configs

2. Check permissions of config files:
   ls -l

3. Notice that these files don't have 'x' - and they shouldn't!

4. Try to "run" a config file (it will fail, which is correct):
   ./app.conf (will fail - config files aren't executable)

5. Now check scripts in projects/web_app:
   cd ../../projects/web_app
   ls -l

6. Compare:
   - Scripts (.sh files meant to run) → need x
   - Config files (.conf, .json) → don't need x
   - Data files (.txt, .log) → don't need x

7. Go to projects/automation and check those scripts:
   cd ../automation
   ls -l

8. Fix any scripts that need execute permission

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd ../../data/configs
- ls -l
- ./app.conf (will fail - this is expected!)
- cd ../../projects/web_app
- ls -l (compare)
- cd ../automation
- ls -l
- Fix scripts as needed

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
Files that NEED execute permission (x):
- Scripts (.sh, .py, .pl, etc.) that are meant to be run
- Binary executables
- Programs

Files that DON'T need execute permission:
- Configuration files (.conf, .json, .yaml, .ini)
- Data files (.txt, .log, .csv)
- Documentation (.md, .txt)
- Source code files (.c, .java, .js) - unless they're scripts

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After exploring different file types, write in my_answers.txt:
- What types of files need execute permission?
- What types of files don't need execute permission?
- Why don't config files need 'x'?
- What happens if you try to "run" a config file?
