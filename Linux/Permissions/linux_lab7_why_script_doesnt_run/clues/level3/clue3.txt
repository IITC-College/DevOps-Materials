                            LEVEL 3 - EXERCISE 3
                    "The Complete Fix" - Master Challenge
================================================================================

Welcome to the Final Exercise!

This is your chance to demonstrate everything you've learned. Fix all
broken scripts across multiple directories!

EXERCISE:
---------
Scan the entire lab and fix all scripts that need execute permission.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Start from the lab root directory:
   cd ../../..

2. Scan each directory for scripts:
   - scripts/broken/
   - projects/web_app/
   - projects/automation/
   - Any other directories with scripts

3. For each directory:
   a. Run `ls -l` to see all files
   b. Identify scripts (files ending in .sh that should be executable)
   c. Check if they have 'x' permission
   d. Add appropriate execute permission using:
      - chmod +x (for public scripts)
      - chmod u+x (for private scripts)
      - chmod g+x (for team scripts)
      - chmod u+x,g+x (for owner and group)

4. Test each fixed script:
   ./script.sh

5. Verify that non-script files (configs, data) don't have x

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l (in each directory)
- chmod +x, chmod u+x, chmod g+x, chmod u+x,g+x (as appropriate)
- ./script.sh (test after fixing)

FINAL CHECKLIST:
----------------
- [ ] All scripts in scripts/broken/ have execute permission
- [ ] All scripts in projects/web_app/ have execute permission
- [ ] All scripts in projects/automation/ have execute permission
- [ ] All scripts run successfully when executed
- [ ] Config files do NOT have execute permission (correct!)
- [ ] Data files do NOT have execute permission (correct!)

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After fixing everything, write in my_answers.txt:

1. List all the scripts you fixed:
   - Script name
   - What permission you added (chmod +x, u+x, g+x, etc.)
   - Why you chose that permission

2. List any files you checked but did NOT add execute to:
   - File name
   - Why it doesn't need execute permission

3. Reflection: Write 2-3 sentences about what you learned in this lab.

                            CONGRATULATIONS!
================================================================================

You've completed the Why Script Doesn't Run Lab!

You've learned:
✓ Why scripts need execute permission (x) to run
✓ How to check permissions with ls -l before changing
✓ How to add execute permission with chmod
✓ How to target specific users (u+x, g+x, +x)
✓ When files need execute permission and when they don't
✓ How to fix broken scripts in real projects

Most importantly, you've developed the habit of READING permissions BEFORE
changing them, and understanding WHAT you're changing and WHY.

In the next labs, you'll learn about ownership (chown) and other permission
concepts. But remember: always READ before you CHANGE!

Well done! 🎉
