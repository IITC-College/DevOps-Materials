                    "The Broken Project" - Real-World Fix
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 3!

You're now ready for real-world scenarios! This exercise simulates fixing
a broken project where multiple scripts need execute permissions.

EXERCISE:
---------
Fix all broken scripts in a web application project.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the web application project:
   cd ../../projects/web_app

2. List all files and check their permissions:
   ls -l

3. Identify which files are scripts (end with .sh) and which are missing 'x'

4. For each script missing execute permission, add it appropriately:
   - start.sh and stop.sh: These should be runnable by everyone (chmod +x)
   - deploy.sh: This is for the team (chmod g+x or chmod u+x,g+x)
   - config.sh: This is a config file, NOT a script - it doesn't need x!

5. After fixing, try running each script:
   ./start.sh
   ./stop.sh
   ./deploy.sh

6. Verify that config.sh does NOT need x (it's not meant to be executed)

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd ../../projects/web_app
- ls -l
- chmod +x start.sh
- chmod +x stop.sh
- chmod g+x deploy.sh (or chmod u+x,g+x deploy.sh)
- ./start.sh (test)
- ./stop.sh (test)
- ./deploy.sh (test)

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
Not all .sh files are meant to be executed:
- Scripts that should run → need x
- Config files with .sh extension → don't need x
- Always check the file content to understand its purpose

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After fixing the project, write in my_answers.txt:
- Which scripts did you fix?
- What permissions did you add to each script and why?
- Why doesn't config.sh need execute permission?
- What did each script output when you ran it?
