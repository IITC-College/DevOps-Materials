                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 3
                    "Combining Permissions" - Multiple Changes at Once
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 3!

You can combine multiple permission changes in a single `chmod` command.
This is useful when you want to add execute permission to both owner and
group at the same time.

EXERCISE:
---------
Learn to add execute permission to multiple users in one command.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the scripts/broken directory:
   cd ../../scripts/broken

2. Check team_script.sh (you added g+x in Exercise 2; owner still has no x):
   ls -l team_script.sh

3. Add execute permission to BOTH owner and group in one command:
   chmod u+x,g+x team_script.sh

4. Check the result:
   ls -l team_script.sh

5. Notice that both owner and group now have 'x' (group had x from Exercise 2;
   this command added owner x and keeps group x)

6. Compare with chmod +x: If you had used chmod +x, others would also get x.
   - chmod u+x,g+x = owner AND group get x (others don't)
   - chmod +x = owner, group, AND others all get x

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l
- chmod u+x,g+x <script>
- chmod +x <script>
- Compare the results with ls -l

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
You can combine multiple changes:
- `chmod u+x,g+x` = Add x to owner AND group
- `chmod u+x,o+x` = Add x to owner AND others
- `chmod g+x,o+x` = Add x to group AND others
- `chmod +x` = Add x to everyone (same as u+x,g+x,o+x)

WHEN TO USE:
------------
- `chmod u+x` = Only owner should run it (private script)
- `chmod g+x` = Owner and group should run it (team script)
- `chmod u+x,g+x` = Owner and group, but not others (team script)
- `chmod +x` = Everyone should run it (public script)

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt (in the main lab directory):
- What is the difference between 'chmod u+x,g+x' and 'chmod +x'?
- When would you use 'chmod u+x,g+x' instead of 'chmod +x'?
- What permissions would you use for a script that only the owner should run?
- What permissions would you use for a script that the whole team should run?

Congratulations! You've completed Level 2!
