                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 3
                    "Combining Permissions" - Multiple Changes at Once
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 3!

You can combine multiple permission changes in a single `chmod` command.
This is useful when you want to add execute permission to both owner and
group at the same time.

EXERCISE:
---------
Learn to add execute permission to multiple users in one command.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the scripts/broken directory:
   cd ../../scripts/broken

2. Find a script that needs both owner and group execute:
   ls -l

3. Add execute permission to BOTH owner and group:
   chmod u+x,g+x team_script.sh
   (or use a script that needs this)

4. Check the result:
   ls -l team_script.sh

5. Notice that both owner and group have 'x'

6. Compare with using chmod +x:
   chmod +x another_script.sh
   ls -l another_script.sh

7. Notice the difference:
   - chmod u+x,g+x = owner AND group get x (others don't)
   - chmod +x = owner, group, AND others all get x

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l
- chmod u+x,g+x <script>
- chmod +x <script>
- Compare the results with ls -l

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
You can combine multiple changes:
- `chmod u+x,g+x` = Add x to owner AND group
- `chmod u+x,o+x` = Add x to owner AND others
- `chmod g+x,o+x` = Add x to group AND others
- `chmod +x` = Add x to everyone (same as u+x,g+x,o+x)

WHEN TO USE:
------------
- `chmod u+x` = Only owner should run it (private script)
- `chmod g+x` = Owner and group should run it (team script)
- `chmod u+x,g+x` = Owner and group, but not others (team script)
- `chmod +x` = Everyone should run it (public script)

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- What is the difference between 'chmod u+x,g+x' and 'chmod +x'?
- When would you use 'chmod u+x,g+x' instead of 'chmod +x'?
- What permissions would you use for a script that only the owner should run?
- What permissions would you use for a script that the whole team should run?

Congratulations! You've completed Level 2!
