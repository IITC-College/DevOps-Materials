                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 1
                    "Adding x to Owner Only" - Targeted Changes
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 2!

You've learned `chmod +x` which adds execute permission for everyone. Now
let's learn to be more specific - adding execute permission only to the
owner using `chmod u+x`.

EXERCISE:
---------
Learn to add execute permission only to the owner, not everyone.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the scripts/broken directory:
   cd ../../scripts/broken

2. Check permissions of private_script.sh:
   ls -l private_script.sh

3. Notice the current permissions (should be -rw-------)

4. Add execute permission ONLY to the owner:
   chmod u+x private_script.sh

5. Check permissions again:
   ls -l private_script.sh

6. Notice that only the owner (first 3 characters) has 'x'

7. Try running the script:
   ./private_script.sh

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l private_script.sh
- chmod u+x private_script.sh
- ls -l private_script.sh (verify)
- ./private_script.sh

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
- `chmod u+x` = Add execute permission to USER (owner) only
- `chmod +x` = Add execute permission to everyone (owner, group, others)

The 'u' stands for "user" (owner). You can also use:
- 'g' for group
- 'o' for others
- 'a' for all (same as no letter)

COMPARISON:
-----------
Before: -rw------- (owner: rw, no execute)
After:  -rwx------ (owner: rwx, has execute)

Only the owner can run this script now!

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- What were the permissions before chmod u+x?
- What were the permissions after chmod u+x?
- What is the difference between 'chmod u+x' and 'chmod +x'?
- When would you use 'chmod u+x' instead of 'chmod +x'?
