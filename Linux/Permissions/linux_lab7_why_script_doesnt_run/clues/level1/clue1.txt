                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 1
                    "The Script That Won't Run" - Your First Fix
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 1!

Your first exercise: Encountering a script that won't run and fixing it.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
In Linux, scripts need the execute permission (x) to run. When you try to
run a script without execute permission, you'll get "Permission denied".
This is different from reading a file - you need special permission to
execute (run) a file as a program.

EXERCISE:
---------
Try to run a script and see what happens. Then fix it!

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the scripts/broken directory:
   cd ../../scripts/broken

2. Try to run the hello.sh script:
   ./hello.sh

3. Look at the error message - what does it say?

4. Check the permissions of the script:
   ls -l hello.sh

5. Notice that the permissions don't have 'x' (execute)

6. Add execute permission:
   chmod +x hello.sh

7. Check the permissions again:
   ls -l hello.sh

8. Now try running it again:
   ./hello.sh

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd ../../scripts/broken
- ./hello.sh (will fail first time)
- ls -l hello.sh
- chmod +x hello.sh
- ./hello.sh (should work now!)

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- What error message appears when you try to run the script?
- What are the permissions before adding x?
- What are the permissions after adding x?
- Does the script run successfully after fixing?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
The `chmod +x` command adds execute permission for everyone (owner, group,
and others). This allows the file to be run as a program.

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- What error message did you see when trying to run hello.sh?
- What were the permissions before chmod +x?
- What were the permissions after chmod +x?
- What did the script output when it ran successfully?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: The key is understanding that scripts need 'x' to run!
