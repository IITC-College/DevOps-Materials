                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 3
                    "Understanding the x Permission" - Why It Matters
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 3!

Now let's understand WHY the execute permission is needed. You fixed hello.sh
in Exercise 1 and backup/deploy/cleanup in Exercise 2 – but you have NOT fixed
private_script.sh yet. The scripts/broken and scripts/fixed directories both
contain private_script.sh (same script). In broken it has no 'x'; in fixed it
has 'x'. Compare them to see the difference before you fix it.

EXERCISE:
---------
Compare private_script.sh in broken vs fixed (same script, different permissions).
You haven't fixed private_script.sh yet, so you'll see the difference.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Check permissions in the broken scripts directory:
   cd ../../scripts/broken
   ls -l

2. Check permissions in the fixed scripts directory (same script, with execute):
   cd ../fixed
   ls -l

3. Compare private_script.sh in BOTH directories (don't fix it yet!):
   - In broken: private_script.sh has no 'x' (e.g. -rw-------)
   - In fixed: private_script.sh has 'x' (e.g. -rwxr-xr-x)
   - Same script – the only difference is the execute bit

4. Try running private_script.sh from the broken directory (will fail – no x):
   cd ../broken
   ./private_script.sh

5. Try running private_script.sh from the fixed directory (same script, has x, works):
   cd ../fixed
   ./private_script.sh

6. Do NOT fix private_script.sh in the broken directory yet! In Level 2 you will
   learn to add execute for the owner only (chmod u+x). Leave it as-is for now.

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l (in both directories)
- Compare private_script.sh permission strings in broken vs fixed
- ./private_script.sh (try in broken, then in fixed – do not chmod the broken copy yet)

UNDERSTANDING PERMISSIONS:
--------------------------
Permission string format: -rwxr-xr-x
                          │ ││ ││ ││
                          │ ││ ││ │└─ Others: execute
                          │ ││ ││ └── Others: write
                          │ ││ │└──── Others: read
                          │ ││ └───── Group: execute
                          │ │└─────── Group: write
                          │ └──────── Group: read
                          └────────── Owner: execute

A script WITHOUT x: -rw-r--r-- (cannot be executed)
A script WITH x:    -rwxr-xr-x (can be executed)

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After comparing the directories, write in my_answers.txt (in the main lab directory):
- What is the main difference between broken and fixed scripts?
- What does 'x' in permissions mean?
- Why do scripts need 'x' permission to run?
- What happens when you try to run a script without 'x'?

Congratulations! You've completed Level 1!

Then proceed to Level 2: cd ../../clues/level2
Read clue1.txt – you'll fix private_script.sh there using chmod u+x (owner only).
