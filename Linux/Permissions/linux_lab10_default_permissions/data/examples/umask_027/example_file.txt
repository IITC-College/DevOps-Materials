This file was created with umask 027.

With umask 027:
- Files get permissions: 666 - 027 = 640 (rw-r-----)
- Directories get permissions: 777 - 027 = 750 (rwxr-x---)

This means:
- Owner: read + write
- Group: read only
- Others: nothing

This is good for team environments where group members need access but outsiders should not.
