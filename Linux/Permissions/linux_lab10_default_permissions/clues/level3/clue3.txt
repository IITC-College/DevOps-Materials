    LEVEL 3 - EXERCISE 3: Synthesis Challenge
================================================================================

TASK: Given a requirement, determine the correct umask value and verify it

This is your final challenge! You'll need to combine everything you've learned
to solve a real problem.

================================================================================
    THE CHALLENGE
================================================================================

Requirement: "I need to create files that are readable by my group members,
but not by others. Only I should be able to write to them."

Your task:
1. Determine what permissions the files should have
2. Calculate what umask value will produce those permissions
3. Set the umask
4. Create a test file
5. Verify the permissions match the requirement

================================================================================
    STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION
================================================================================

Step 1: Determine required permissions
  - Owner: read + write = rw- (6)
  - Group: read only = r-- (4)
  - Others: nothing = --- (0)
  - Result: 640 (rw-r-----)

Step 2: Calculate umask
  - For files: 666 - umask = 640
  - Therefore: umask = 666 - 640 = 026
  - Wait... let's verify: 666 - 026 = 640 ✓

Step 3: Set umask and test
  Run: umask 026
  Run: touch final_test.txt
  Run: ls -l final_test.txt
  Expected: -rw-r----- (640)

Step 4: Verify it meets the requirement
  - Owner can read and write? Yes / No
  - Group can read? Yes / No
  - Group can write? Yes / No (should be No)
  - Others can read? Yes / No (should be No)

================================================================================
    CONGRATULATIONS!
================================================================================

🎉 You've completed Level 3 and the entire lab! 🎉

You now understand:
  ✓ How to check and modify umask
  ✓ How umask affects file and directory permissions
  ✓ How to calculate permissions from umask values
  ✓ Security implications of different umask values
  ✓ When to use different umask values in real scenarios
  ✓ How to determine the right umask for specific requirements

================================================================================
    KEY TAKEAWAY
================================================================================

Remember: Default permissions are not random - they are INTENTIONAL DECISIONS.

By understanding umask, you can:
  - Make informed security decisions
  - Balance security with collaboration needs
  - Plan ahead before creating files
  - Control who can access your files by default

================================================================================
    FINAL STEP
================================================================================

Create your answers file:
  cd ../..
  touch my_answers.txt

Write down all your answers from all three levels, then save the file.

Well done! You've mastered umask and default permissions!
