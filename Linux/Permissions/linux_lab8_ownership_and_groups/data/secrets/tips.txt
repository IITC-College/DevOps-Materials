OWNERSHIP TIPS:

1. Always check who you are first: whoami, id, groups

2. Read ownership before accessing files: ls -l

3. Ownership determines which permission set applies:
   - Are you the owner? → Owner permissions
   - Are you in the group? → Group permissions
   - Otherwise → Other permissions

4. chown requires sudo - only root can change ownership

5. Groups enable team collaboration without world-readable files

6. Service files should be owned by service users (www-data, mysql, etc.)

7. Team files: owner=individual, group=team

Remember: Permissions tell you WHAT you can do, ownership tells you WHO you are!
