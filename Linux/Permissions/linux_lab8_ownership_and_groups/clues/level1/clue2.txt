                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 2
                    "Reading Ownership" - Understanding ls -l Output
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 1, Exercise 2!

Your task: Learn to read file ownership from `ls -l` output.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
When you run `ls -l`, you see a lot of information. One of the most important
pieces is WHO OWNS each file. Every file in Linux has:
- An owner (a user)
- A group (a group that the file belongs to)

The format in `ls -l` output is: owner:group

EXERCISE:
---------
Navigate to a directory with files and read their ownership information.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the data/files directory:
   
   cd ../../data/files

2. List files with detailed information:
   
   ls -l

3. Look carefully at the output - find the owner and group columns

4. Compare the ownership of different files

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd ../../data/files
- ls -l

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- What is the format of the ownership information? (owner:group)
- Who owns the first file you see?
- What group does that file belong to?
- Do all files have the same owner?
- Do all files have the same group?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
The `ls -l` output shows ownership in this format:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 username groupname 1234 Jan 27 10:00 filename.txt
          ^         ^      ^
          |         |      |
    permissions  owner  group
```

- The owner is the user who created the file (or who it was assigned to)
- The group is the group the file belongs to
- Both owner and group affect which permissions apply to you
- The format is always: owner:group (when shown separately)

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After examining the files, write in my_answers.txt:
- What is the format for showing ownership in ls -l? (e.g., "username:groupname")
- Who owns the files in data/files/?
- What groups do these files belong to?
- In your own words, what does "owner" mean for a file?
- In your own words, what does "group" mean for a file?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue3.txt in this same directory.

Hint: The owner:group format tells you TWO important things: who owns the file,
and which group the file belongs to. Both matter for access control!
