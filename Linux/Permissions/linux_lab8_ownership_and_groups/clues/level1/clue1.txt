                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 1
                    "Who Am I?" - Discovering Your Identity
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 1!

Your first exercise: Discovering who you are in the Linux system.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
In Linux, every action you take is associated with your user identity. Before
you can understand file ownership, you need to know who YOU are. Linux tracks
your identity in multiple ways: username, user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and
group memberships.

EXERCISE:
---------
Discover your identity using three different commands.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Find out your username:
   
   whoami

2. Get detailed information about your identity:
   
   id

3. See which groups you belong to:
   
   groups

4. Look at the output of each command carefully

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- whoami
- id
- groups

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- What is your username? (from `whoami`)
- What is your user ID (uid)? (from `id`)
- What is your primary group ID (gid)? (from `id`)
- What groups are you a member of? (from `groups`)
- How many groups do you belong to?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
- `whoami` shows your username - the simple answer to "who am I?"
- `id` shows your numeric IDs (uid, gid) and all your group memberships
- `groups` shows just the group names you belong to
- Your primary group (gid) is the default group for new files you create
- Additional groups give you access to resources owned by those groups

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After running the commands, write in my_answers.txt:
- What is your username?
- What is your user ID (uid)?
- What is your primary group ID (gid)?
- List at least 3 groups you belong to
- Why do you think Linux tracks identity in multiple ways (username, uid, groups)?

You can write your answer in a file called my_answers.txt in the main lab
directory (go back with: cd ../../..)

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: Your identity in Linux is more than just a username - it includes your
user ID, primary group, and all group memberships!
