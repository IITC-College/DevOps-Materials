                            LEVEL 3 - EXERCISE 1
        "Web Server Files" - Ownership in Production Systems
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 3!

Your task: Understand how ownership works in real DevOps scenarios - web servers.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
In production systems, different services run as different users for security.
For example:
- Web servers (nginx, Apache) run as `www-data` or `nginx` user
- Database servers run as `mysql` or `postgres` user
- Application files need correct ownership for the service to access them

This is a security best practice: services run with minimal privileges, not as root!

EXERCISE:
---------
Examine a web application project and understand why ownership matters for deployment.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the web application project:
   
   cd ../../projects/web_app

2. List files with detailed information:
   
   ls -l

3. Check who owns the files:
   - Look at the owner column
   - Look at the group column

4. Read the README to understand the deployment scenario:
   
   cat README.md

5. Try to understand why certain files have specific ownership

6. If needed, use chown to fix ownership for deployment:
   
   sudo chown www-data:www-data config.json

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- cd ../../projects/web_app
- ls -l
- cat README.md
- sudo chown www-data:www-data config.json (if needed)

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- Who owns the files in the web_app directory?
- What groups do the files belong to?
- Why do you think web server files are owned by www-data?
- What happens if a web server file is owned by root?
- What happens if a web server file is owned by a regular user?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
Web servers run as specific users (like `www-data` or `nginx`) for security:
- The web server process runs as that user
- Files the web server needs to read must be accessible to that user
- This means files should be owned by the web server user (or group)
- This is called "principle of least privilege" - services get only what they need

Common ownership patterns:
- Web files: `www-data:www-data` or `nginx:nginx`
- Config files: `www-data:www-data` (readable by web server)
- Log files: `www-data:www-data` (writable by web server)

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After examining the web app, write in my_answers.txt:
- Who should own web server files? Why?
- What is the "principle of least privilege"?
- Why don't web servers run as root?
- In your own words, explain why ownership matters for web server deployment.
- What would happen if config.json was owned by root instead of www-data?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: Services run as specific users for security. Files those services need
must be owned by (or accessible to) those service users!
