                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 2
        "Group Membership Matters" - How Groups Enable Access
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 2, Exercise 2!

Your task: Understand how group membership affects file access.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
Groups are a way to share access to files among multiple users. If a file is
owned by a group you belong to, you get the GROUP permissions (not the "other"
permissions). This is how teams share files in Linux.

EXERCISE:
---------
Examine files with group ownership and see how your group membership affects
access.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Check which groups you belong to:
   
   groups

2. Navigate to the data/files directory:
   
   cd ../../data/files

3. List files with detailed information:
   
   ls -l

4. Look for files with group ownership (check the group column)

5. For each file, determine:
   - What group owns it?
   - Are you a member of that group? (check with `groups`)
   - What are the group permissions?
   - Can you access the file based on group permissions?

6. Try to read a file owned by a group you belong to:
   
   cat group_file.txt

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- groups
- cd ../../data/files
- ls -l
- cat group_file.txt

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- What groups do files belong to?
- Are you a member of any of those groups? (check with `groups`)
- What are the group permissions for files in your groups?
- Can you access files based on group membership?
- What happens if a file's group is one you DON'T belong to?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
Group membership is checked SECOND (after owner check):

1. Are you the owner? → Use owner permissions
2. Are you in the group? → Use group permissions
3. Otherwise → Use other permissions

Example:
- File: `-rwxr-x--- user1 developers file.txt`
- Group permissions: `r-x` (read and execute)
- If you're in `developers` group → You get `r-x` access
- If you're NOT in `developers` group → You get `---` (other permissions = no access)

This is how teams share files: owner=individual, group=team, group permissions=shared access!

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After examining the files, write in my_answers.txt:
- List the groups that files belong to in data/files/
- Which of those groups are you a member of? (check with `groups`)
- For a file in a group you belong to: what permissions do you get?
- For a file in a group you DON'T belong to: what permissions do you get?
- In your own words, explain how groups enable file sharing in teams.

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue3.txt in this same directory.

Hint: Groups are the key to collaboration! Files owned by your group give you
group permissions, enabling team members to share access without making files
world-readable.
