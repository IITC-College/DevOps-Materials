Tips for Responsible sudo Usage:

1. Think Before You sudo
   - Ask: "Is this really an administrative task?"
   - Consider: "Is there a better solution?"
   - Remember: "Permission denied" doesn't always mean "use sudo"

2. Fix Root Causes
   - Use sudo to fix ownership/permissions ONCE
   - Don't use sudo repeatedly for the same file
   - Solve the problem, don't work around it

3. Understand Accountability
   - Every sudo command is logged
   - Your actions are tracked
   - You are responsible for what you do with sudo

4. Use sudo Appropriately
   - System administration tasks: YES
   - Installing packages: YES
   - Modifying system configs: YES
   - Reading your own files: NO
   - Working around bad design: NO

5. Security Best Practices
   - Use sudo only when necessary
   - Understand what you're doing
   - Read error messages carefully
   - Consider alternatives before using sudo

Remember: With great power comes great responsibility!
