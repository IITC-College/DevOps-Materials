                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 2
                    "Understanding sudo Logging: You Are Being Watched!"
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 2!

Now you'll learn a crucial fact: Every sudo command you run is LOGGED. This
is for security, accountability, and audit purposes. You are responsible
for what you do with sudo!

BACKGROUND:
-----------
Every time you use sudo, the system logs:
- Who ran the command (your username)
- What command was executed
- When it was executed (timestamp)
- From which terminal/session
- Whether it succeeded or failed

This audit trail is stored in:
- `/var/log/auth.log` (Debian/Ubuntu systems)
- `/var/log/secure` (RHEL/CentOS systems)

Only root (or users with sudo) can read these logs. This is intentional -
audit logs are sensitive and should be protected.

EXERCISE:
---------
You'll learn about sudo logging and where to find the audit trail.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. First, run a sudo command so we have something to log:
   sudo ls /root

2. Now try to read the authentication log:
   cat /var/log/auth.log

3. You'll get "Permission denied" - why?
   ls -l /var/log/auth.log

4. The log file is protected! Only root can read it. Use sudo:
   sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | tail -20

5. Look for entries that contain "sudo" - you should see your recent command!

6. Also check the simulated log in the lab:
   cat ../../data/logs/sudo_example.log

7. This file shows example sudo log entries. Study the format:
   - Timestamp
   - Username
   - Command executed
   - Terminal information

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- sudo ls /root (create a log entry)
- cat /var/log/auth.log (will fail - protected)
- ls -l /var/log/auth.log
- sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | tail -20 (view recent entries)
- grep sudo /var/log/auth.log | tail -5 (search for sudo entries)
- cat ../../data/logs/sudo_example.log (view example log)

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- Why can't regular users read /var/log/auth.log?
- What information is logged when you use sudo?
- Can you find your recent sudo command in the log?
- What does the log entry format look like?
- Why is sudo logging important?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
sudo logging is important because:
- **Security**: Tracks who has elevated privileges
- **Accountability**: You are responsible for what you do with sudo
- **Audit**: System administrators can review sudo usage
- **Compliance**: Many organizations require audit trails
- **Troubleshooting**: Helps identify security issues

What gets logged:
- Username who ran sudo
- Command that was executed
- Timestamp of execution
- Terminal/session information
- Success or failure status

Real-world implications:
- Your sudo usage is tracked
- System administrators can see what you did
- This is a security feature, not a bug
- Be responsible with sudo!

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- Why can't regular users read /var/log/auth.log?
- What information is logged when you use sudo?
- Where are sudo logs stored? (Give both Debian and RHEL locations)
- Why is sudo logging important for security?
- What are the real-world implications of sudo logging?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue3.txt in this same directory.

Hint: Remember - every sudo command is logged. You are accountable for
what you do with elevated privileges!
