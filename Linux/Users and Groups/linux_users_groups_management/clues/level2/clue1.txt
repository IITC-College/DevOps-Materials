                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 1
                    "Creating and Viewing Groups"
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 2!

Now that you understand users, let's learn about groups - the way Linux
controls shared access to files and resources.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
Groups in Linux allow multiple users to share access to files and directories.
Instead of giving each user individual permissions, you can:
1. Create a group
2. Add users to that group
3. Set file permissions for the group

Common examples:
- 'developers' group: All developers can read/write shared code
- 'www-data' group: Web server can access web application files
- 'docker' group: Users who can run Docker commands

Just like users, groups have:
- A group name (e.g., 'developers')
- A numeric Group ID (GID)
- A list of members

EXERCISE:
---------
You'll create groups and learn to view group information.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Create a new group called 'developers':
   sudo groupadd developers

2. Create another group called 'testers':
   sudo groupadd testers

3. View all groups on the system:
   getent group

4. View information about the developers group specifically:
   getent group developers

5. View information about the testers group:
   getent group testers

6. Count how many groups exist on the system:
   getent group | wc -l

7. Check if testuser1 is in any groups besides their primary group:
   groups testuser1

8. View your own groups:
   groups

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- sudo groupadd developers
- sudo groupadd testers
- getent group
- getent group developers
- getent group testers
- getent group | wc -l
- groups testuser1
- groups

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- How many total groups are on the system?
- What information does 'getent group developers' show?
- What is the GID of the developers group?
- Are there any members listed in the developers group yet?
- What groups does testuser1 belong to currently?
- What's the format of the group database entries?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
The /etc/group format (4 fields, separated by colons):
groupname:x:GID:member_list

Example: developers:x:1003:alice,bob,charlie

Field breakdown:
1. groupname: Name of the group (developers)
2. x: Password placeholder (rarely used)
3. GID: Group ID number (1003)
4. member_list: Comma-separated list of members (alice,bob,charlie)

Important note: The member_list in /etc/group shows SECONDARY group members
only. Primary group membership is defined in /etc/passwd (each user's GID).

Types of groups:
- Primary group: Every user has ONE primary group (set in /etc/passwd)
  - New files created by user belong to this group by default
- Secondary groups: Users can belong to MULTIPLE secondary groups
  - Listed in /etc/group or added via usermod -aG

System groups vs Regular groups:
- System groups (GID < 1000): For system services (www-data, mysql, docker)
- Regular groups (GID >= 1000): For users and projects

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- What is the GID of the developers group?
- What is the full getent group line for developers?
- How many groups are on your system?
- Are there any members in the developers group yet?
- What's the difference between a primary group and secondary group?
- Why are groups useful in Linux?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: Groups are one of the fundamental security mechanisms in Linux. They
allow you to share access to files among team members while keeping them
private from others!
