                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 1
                    "Creating Users: adduser vs useradd"
================================================================================

Welcome to Level 1!

Your first exercise: Learning how to create users in Linux and understanding
the important differences between adduser and useradd.

BACKGROUND:
-----------
In Linux, there are two main commands for creating users: adduser and useradd.
While they both create users, they work very differently!

- adduser: Interactive, user-friendly command that creates home directory,
  sets up password, copies default files, and asks for user information.
  
- useradd: Low-level command that creates a basic user account but requires
  you to manually configure everything (home directory, password, shell, etc.)

Understanding the difference is important because you'll encounter both in
real-world scenarios!

EXERCISE:
---------
You'll create two test users - one with adduser and one with useradd - then
compare the results to understand the differences.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. First, create a user with adduser (the easy way):
   sudo adduser testuser1

2. Follow the interactive prompts:
   - Enter a password (you can use: Test123!)
   - Re-enter the password
   - For the user information (Full Name, Room Number, etc.), just press Enter
   - Confirm by typing 'Y' when asked

3. Now create a user with useradd (the manual way):
   sudo useradd testuser2

4. Check if testuser1 has a home directory:
   ls -la /home | grep testuser1

5. Check if testuser2 has a home directory:
   ls -la /home | grep testuser2

6. View detailed information about both users:
   getent passwd testuser1
   getent passwd testuser2

7. Check if testuser2 has a password set:
   sudo passwd -S testuser2

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- sudo adduser testuser1
- sudo useradd testuser2
- ls -la /home | grep testuser1
- ls -la /home | grep testuser2
- getent passwd testuser1
- getent passwd testuser2
- sudo passwd -S testuser2

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- Which command was interactive (asked questions)?
- Does testuser1 have a home directory? (/home/testuser1)
- Does testuser2 have a home directory? (/home/testuser2)
- What's the difference in the getent passwd output?
- Does testuser2 have a password set?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
adduser (Debian/Ubuntu):
- Interactive and user-friendly
- Creates home directory automatically
- Sets up password interactively
- Copies default configuration files
- Recommended for manual user creation

useradd (All Linux distributions):
- Low-level, non-interactive
- Does NOT create home directory by default
- Does NOT set up password
- Requires manual configuration
- Used in scripts and automation

For manual user creation, adduser is usually better. For scripts and
automation, useradd with options is more predictable.

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt (in the main lab directory):
- Which command was interactive: adduser or useradd?
- Did testuser1 have a home directory created automatically?
- Did testuser2 have a home directory created automatically?
- What would you need to do to make testuser2 fully functional?
- When would you use adduser vs useradd?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue2.txt in this same directory.

Hint: adduser is a friendlier wrapper around useradd! For creating users
manually, adduser is usually the better choice. For scripts, useradd with
proper options gives you more control.
