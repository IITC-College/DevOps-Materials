                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 3
                    "Viewing All Users: The System User Database"
================================================================================

You've learned to check your own user information. Now let's see ALL users
on the system!

BACKGROUND:
-----------
Linux is a multi-user operating system. Even on a single-user desktop, there
are many "users" - most are system users that run services and daemons.

The user database is stored in /etc/passwd (despite the name, it doesn't
contain passwords - those are in /etc/shadow). However, the best way to query
this database is using the 'getent' command.

getent (get entries) can query various system databases:
- getent passwd: Query the user database
- getent group: Query the group database
- getent passwd username: Get specific user information

Understanding the user database helps you see the difference between regular
users and system users.

EXERCISE:
---------
You'll explore the system user database and learn to interpret the information.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. View all users on the system:
   getent passwd

2. Notice how many users there are! Now filter to see only your test users:
   getent passwd | grep testuser

3. View specific user information:
   getent passwd testuser1

4. View information about a system user (www-data):
   getent passwd www-data

5. Count how many users are on the system:
   getent passwd | wc -l

6. View only regular users (UID >= 1000):
   getent passwd | awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 {print $1, "UID:", $3}'

7. View your own user information from the database:
   getent passwd $USER

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- getent passwd
- getent passwd | grep testuser
- getent passwd testuser1
- getent passwd www-data
- getent passwd | wc -l
- getent passwd | awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 {print $1, "UID:", $3}'
- getent passwd $USER

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- How many total users are on the system?
- What information does each line show?
- What's the difference between testuser1 and www-data entries?
- What's the format of each line?
- Which users have UID < 1000 (system users)?
- Which users have UID >= 1000 (regular users)?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
The /etc/passwd format (7 fields, separated by colons):
username:x:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:shell

Example: testuser1:x:1001:1001::/home/testuser1:/bin/bash

Field breakdown:
1. username: Login name (testuser1)
2. x: Password placeholder (actual password in /etc/shadow)
3. UID: User ID number (1001)
4. GID: Primary group ID (1001)
5. comment: Full name or description (usually empty or full name)
6. home_directory: User's home directory (/home/testuser1)
7. shell: Login shell (/bin/bash, /bin/sh, or /usr/sbin/nologin for system users)

System users vs Regular users:
- System users (UID < 1000): Run services, no login shell, no home in /home
  Examples: www-data, mysql, sshd
- Regular users (UID >= 1000): Can log in, have home directory in /home
  Examples: your user, testuser1, testuser2

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- How many total users are on your system?
- What is the full getent passwd line for testuser1?
- Break down each field of testuser1's entry and explain what it means
- What's the difference between testuser1 and www-data entries?
- Why do system users exist?
- What shell does testuser1 have? What does this mean?

You've completed Level 1! Now navigate to Level 2:
   cd ../level2
   cat clue1.txt

Hint: System users are essential for security - they allow services to run
with limited privileges instead of running everything as root!
