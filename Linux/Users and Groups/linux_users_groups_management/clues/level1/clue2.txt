                            LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 2
                    "Discovering User Information: Who Am I?"
================================================================================

Now that you've created users, let's learn how to discover information about
users on the system!

BACKGROUND:
-----------
In Linux, you often need to find out:
- Who you are currently logged in as (your username)
- Your user ID (UID) and group ID (GID)
- What groups you belong to
- Information about other users

Linux provides several commands to discover this information:
- whoami: Shows your current username
- id: Shows your UID, GID, and all groups you belong to
- groups: Lists all groups you're a member of

Understanding user and group IDs is important because Linux uses these numbers
internally for permissions and access control!

EXERCISE:
---------
You'll use various commands to discover information about yourself and the
test users you created.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Find out your current username:
   whoami

2. Get your full user information (UID, GID, groups):
   id

3. List all groups you belong to:
   groups

4. Now check information about testuser1:
   id testuser1

5. Check what groups testuser1 belongs to:
   groups testuser1

6. Get your username again, but from the environment variable:
   echo $USER

7. Compare your UID with testuser1's UID:
   id -u
   id -u testuser1

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- whoami
- id
- groups
- id testuser1
- groups testuser1
- echo $USER
- id -u
- id -u testuser1

WHAT TO OBSERVE:
----------------
- What is your username? (from whoami)
- What is your UID? (user ID number)
- What is your primary GID? (group ID number)
- What groups do you belong to?
- What is testuser1's UID?
- What is testuser1's primary group?
- Are UIDs sequential or do they jump?

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
User IDs (UID):
- Every user has a unique numeric ID
- UID 0 is always root (the superuser)
- UIDs 1-999 are typically system users (www-data, mysql, etc.)
- UIDs 1000+ are typically regular users
- Linux uses UIDs internally for permissions

Group IDs (GID):
- Every user has a primary group (shown in 'id' output)
- Users can belong to multiple groups (secondary groups)
- By default, files created by a user belong to their primary group
- GIDs work like UIDs (0-999 system, 1000+ regular users)

The 'id' command output format:
uid=1000(username) gid=1000(groupname) groups=1000(groupname),4(adm),27(sudo)
     ^UID   ^name    ^primary GID        ^all groups with their GIDs

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt:
- What is your username and UID?
- What is your primary group and GID?
- What other groups do you belong to?
- What is testuser1's UID and primary group?
- Why does Linux use numeric IDs instead of just usernames?
- What's the difference between 'whoami' and 'id'?

Then proceed to the next exercise: clue3.txt in this same directory.

Hint: The 'id' command is one of the most useful commands for understanding
your identity and permissions in Linux. Use it often when debugging access
issues!
