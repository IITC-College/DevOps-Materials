                        LAB TIPS AND HINTS
================================================================================

LEVEL 1 TIPS:
-------------
Tip 1.1: adduser is interactive and creates home directory automatically.
         useradd is basic and requires manual configuration.

Tip 1.2: Use 'id username' to see UID, GID, and all group memberships.
         Use 'groups username' to see just the group names.

Tip 1.3: getent passwd queries the user database.
         Format: username:x:UID:GID:comment:home:shell

LEVEL 2 TIPS:
-------------
Tip 2.1: Groups are created with 'groupadd groupname'.
         View with 'getent group groupname'.

Tip 2.2: CRITICAL: Always use -aG to add to groups, never -G alone!
         -aG appends (safe), -G replaces all groups (dangerous!)

Tip 2.3: Passwords are stored encrypted in /etc/shadow.
         Use 'passwd -S' to check password status.

LEVEL 3 TIPS:
-------------
Tip 3.1: usermod -G without -a replaces ALL secondary groups!
         This can break sudo access - very dangerous!

Tip 3.2: deluser removes user, --remove-home removes user AND files.
         Always verify before deleting: id username, ls -la /home/username

Tip 3.3: Cannot delete a group if it's a user's primary group.
         Delete the user first, or change their primary group.

COMMON MISTAKES:
----------------
- Using useradd and wondering where the home directory is
- Using -G instead of -aG and losing all groups
- Trying to delete a primary group while user still uses it
- Deleting users without checking their files first
- Forgetting to verify changes with id/groups/getent

VERIFICATION COMMANDS:
----------------------
After creating user:       id username, getent passwd username
After adding to group:     groups username, getent group groupname
After changing password:   sudo passwd -S username
After deleting user:       id username (should fail), ls -la /home
After deleting group:      getent group groupname (should be empty)

REMEMBER:
---------
- Always verify before deleting
- Use -aG not -G
- Back up before permanent deletion
- Test in lab before production!

Good luck!
