# Linux Lab – Number Guessing Game

Build a number guessing game in bash: the script chooses a random number and the user guesses until correct. Practice variables, `read`, conditionals, and `while` loops.

## Learning Objectives

After this lab you will be able to:
- Generate random numbers in a range with `$RANDOM`
- Use a `while` loop to repeat until a condition is met
- Combine `read`, conditionals, and counters
- Optionally read configuration (e.g. range) from a file
