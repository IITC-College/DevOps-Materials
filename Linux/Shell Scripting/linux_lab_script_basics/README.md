# Linux Lab – Script Basics

Learn the fundamentals of creating and running bash scripts using simple echo statements. Master script creation, shebangs, file permissions, and execution methods through hands-on practice.

## Learning Objectives

After this lab you will be able to:
- Create bash script files with echo statements
- Add and understand shebang lines (`#!/bin/bash`)
- Make scripts executable with `chmod +x`
- Check file permissions with `ls -l`
- Run scripts using `./script.sh` and `bash script.sh`
- Format script output with echo statements
- Understand when to use each execution method

## Duration

20-30 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Linux system with bash
- Text editor (nano, vim, or any editor you prefer)
- Basic command line knowledge

## What You'll Create

Simple bash scripts using only echo commands to practice the fundamentals:
1. **welcome.sh** - Your first script with a welcome message
2. **deploy.sh** - Simulated deployment step messages
3. **status.sh** - Formatted system status report

Each script teaches you the core concepts of bash scripting without complexity - just focus on creating, making executable, and running scripts.
