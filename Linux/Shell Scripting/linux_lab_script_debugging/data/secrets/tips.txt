# Script Debugging Lab - Optional Tips

## Level 1 Clue 1 (spaces in assignment)
- APP_NAME = "myapp" → bash tries to run "APP_NAME" as a command. Fix: APP_NAME="myapp"

## Level 1 Clue 2 (missing quotes)
- [ -f $CONFIG ] → if CONFIG is empty or has spaces, the test breaks. Fix: [ -f "$CONFIG" ]
- Run from scripts/ so ../data/configs/build_config.txt exists.

## Level 1 Clue 3 (missing then)
- if [ ... ] must be followed by "then" on same or next line. Fix: if [ ... ]; then

## Level 2 Clue 1 (wrong path)
- Script uses CONFIG="config.txt" but file is in data/configs/. Fix: CONFIG="../data/configs/build_config.txt" (from scripts/)

## Level 2 Clue 2 (missing fi)
- Every if needs a matching fi. pipeline_broken.sh has an if/else but no fi before the last echo.

## Level 2 Clue 3 (multiple bugs)
- ci_full_broken.sh: spaces in APP_NAME = "myapp", missing quotes in [ -f $CONFIG ], wrong path (config.txt → ../data/configs/ci_config.txt), missing then, missing fi.
