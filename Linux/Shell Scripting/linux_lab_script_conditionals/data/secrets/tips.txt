# Script Conditionals Lab - Optional Tips

## Level 1 Clue 1 (file exists)
- [ -f "$CONFIG" ] – spaces around [ ] are required; quotes around variable prevent errors if path has spaces.
- From projects/, path to data/configs is ../data/configs/

## Level 1 Clue 2 (directory exists)
- [ -d "$DEPLOY_DIR" ] – true if path exists and is a directory.

## Level 1 Clue 3 (empty input)
- [ -z "$VAR" ] – true if VAR is empty. exit 1 stops the script with a non-zero exit code.

## Level 2 Clue 1 (validate env name)
- [ "$ENV" = "prod" ] – string comparison. Use = not == in [ ] for portability.

## Level 2 Clue 2 (mkdir -p)
- mkdir -p creates parent directories and does nothing if the dir already exists.
- [ ! -d "$TARGET" ] – ! negates; true if directory does NOT exist.

## Level 2 Clue 3 (pre-deploy script)
- Combine: read, [ -z ], [ "$ENV" != "prod" ] && [ "$ENV" != "staging" ], [ -f "$CONFIG" ], [ -d "$DEPLOY_DIR" ].
