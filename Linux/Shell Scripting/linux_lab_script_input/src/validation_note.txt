Why Validate Input in Scripts?

Input validation is critical in DevOps scripts for several reasons:

1. Empty Input Problems
   - Users may press Enter without typing anything
   - Variables become empty strings, leading to unexpected behavior
   - Example: checking a service with no name provided

2. Wrong Data Entry
   - Users may typo environment names (e.g., "prod" vs "production")
   - Invalid service names could cause errors
   - Garbage input could be passed to system commands

3. Production Safety
   - Never assume "the user will behave nicely"
   - Empty variables in destructive commands are dangerous
   - Example: rm -rf /$DIRECTORY (if DIRECTORY is empty = disaster)

4. Better User Experience
   - Clear error messages help users fix mistakes
   - Validation provides immediate feedback
   - Prevents scripts from running with bad data

5. Script Reliability
   - Catches problems early before damage is done
   - Makes scripts more robust and production-ready
   - Reduces debugging time when things go wrong

Common Validation Techniques (covered in Conditionals lab):
- Check if variable is empty: [ -z "$VAR" ]
- Check if variable is not empty: [ -n "$VAR" ]
- Check against allowed values: if [ "$ENV" = "prod" ] || [ "$ENV" = "staging" ]
- Provide default values: ${VAR:-default}

Remember: In production DevOps scripts, always validate before taking action!
