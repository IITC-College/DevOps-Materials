## Learning Objectives

After this lab you will be able to:
- Declare variables in bash (`VAR="value"`) and use them (`$VAR`)
- Use command substitution for dynamic values (`DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`)
- Build scripts with variables for reusable, maintainable code
- Create timestamped filenames for backups

## Getting Started
