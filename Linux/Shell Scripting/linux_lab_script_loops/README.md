# Linux Lab – Script Loops

Master bash loops to automate repetitive tasks. Learn `for` and `while` loops, implement retry patterns, and combine loops for complex automation scenarios common in DevOps.

## Learning Objectives

After this lab you will be able to:
- Use `for` loops to iterate over lists
- Use `while` loops with counters
- Read lists from files
- Implement retry patterns with `break`
- Perform arithmetic operations with `$(())`
- Nest loops for complex automation
- Apply loops to real-world DevOps scenarios
