# Ops Helper Lab - Optional Tips

## Level 1 Clue 1 (action choice)
- setup_1_1.sh creates data/ops_env/logs and data/ops_env/configs. List with ls data/ops_env/ from lab root.
- read -p "Action (deploy/check/backup): " ACTION

## Level 1 Clue 2 (if/elif/else)
- [ "$ACTION" = "deploy" ] – use = not == in [ ] for portability.
- else handles any input that is not deploy, check, or backup.

## Level 1 Clue 3 (validation)
- if [ -z "$ACTION" ]; then ... elif [ "$ACTION" = "deploy" ]; then ... (first branch is empty check).

## Level 2 Clue 1 (variables)
- Put APP_NAME, LOG_DIR, CONFIG_DIR at top; use $APP_NAME etc. in echo messages.

## Level 2 Clue 2 (confirmation)
- read -p "Are you sure? (yes/no): " CONFIRM
- if [ "$CONFIRM" != "yes" ]; then echo "Deploy cancelled."; else ... (deploy messages); fi

## Level 2 Clue 3 (complete script)
- No loops or functions – just variables, read, if/elif/else, confirmation for deploy (and optionally backup), echo "Done."
