        "1. **Serialize** the dictionary to JSON automatically—we don't need to call `json.dumps()` ourselves.\n",
        "2. **Set the `Content-Type`** header to `application/json` automatically, so we don't need to set that header explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can inspect the response the same way as with GET: **`response.status_code`**, **`response.json()`** to parse the body, and **`response.raise_for_status()`** to raise an exception on 4xx/5xx and get a fail-fast approach."

        "| **Using `data` instead of `json`** | `data=` sends **form-encoded** data. Many modern APIs expect **JSON**. Use **`json=`** for JSON payloads so the body and `Content-Type` are correct. |\n",
        "| **Hard-coding secrets** | API keys and tokens are sensitive. **Never** hard-code them. Use **environment variables**; for local development, use a **`.env`** file (e.g. with `python-dotenv`). For production, use a proper **secrets management** solution (e.g. HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). |"
