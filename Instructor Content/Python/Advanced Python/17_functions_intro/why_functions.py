# Why do we need functions?

# Problem: Code duplication
print("=" * 30)
print("Welcome to System A")
print("=" * 30)

# More code...

print("=" * 30)
print("Welcome to System B")
print("=" * 30)

# Even more code...

print("=" * 30)
print("Welcome to System C")
print("=" * 30)

# What if we need to change the border? We have to change it 6 times!
# Functions solve this problem by allowing code reuse
